**Class: 16:00 Stage 6 | Method: Top-and-Tailing**

**My Analysis:**
David Patras is consistently struggling with Breaststroke, marked as "Needs Practice" for the last three weeks. This is a priority to address. Fletcher Gull has missing assessment data, suggesting potential attendance issues that need monitoring.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

**Lesson Plan:**

*   **Focus:** Improving Breaststroke timing and efficiency, with a review of core Stage 6 skills.
*   **Swimmers:** 9
*   **Equipment:** Kickboards, woggles, possibly some short pool noodles for breaststroke drills.
*   **Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):**
    *   Welcome and brief outline of the lesson objectives: focus on breaststroke and reviewing skills.
    *   Remind swimmers of pool rules and safety procedures. Quick check on how they are feeling today.
*   **Warm-up (5-7 mins):**
    *   Dynamic warm-up off poolside (e.g., arm circles, leg swings).
    *   Enter water safely.
    *   Moving through water: Front crawl legs kick with woggle (3 x 10m). Focus on maintaining body position.
*   **Main Activity (10-12 mins):**
    *   **Breaststroke Kick Focus:**
        *   **Drill 1 (David Patras focus):** Using kickboards, swimmers perform breaststroke kick with emphasis on timing. "Push and squeeze" technique to feel the water. Keep knees close, feet flexed. (This addresses David's need for practice).
        *   **Drill 2 (Group):** Breaststroke kick with woggle behind shoulders (2 x 15m). Focus on maintaining body position and a consistent kick.
        *   **Drill 3 (David & others needing focus):** Breaststroke arms with woggle (2 x 10m). Focus on "11, Eat, 11" sequence. Encourage correct arm recovery and pull.
*   **Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):**
    *   **Surface Dive Progression:** Swimmers practice the surface dive from a standing position, aiming to retrieve objects from waist-depth. This aligns with "TEACHINGGUIDE.pdf" and provides a different skill focus.
*   **Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):**
    *   "Water polo" style game using a ball, where swimmers use breaststroke kick to move the ball to each other.
    *   Quick recap of the lesson and positive feedback.
    *   Safe exit from the pool.

**Class: 16:30 Stage 1 | Method: Top-and-Tailing**

**My Analysis:**
Ava Brennan is struggling with a fundamental skill: "Push and glide in a flat position on the front from a wall." This needs immediate attention for progression.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

**Class: 17:00 Stage 1 | Method: Top-and-Tailing**

**My Analysis:**
Jacob Robbins is showing a broad range of difficulties, indicating potential water confidence issues. This will require a very gentle and encouraging approach, perhaps focusing on the fundamental skills he is struggling with to build his confidence.
Peggy Thorpe, Sara Stenmark, and Una Earlam are showing consistent issues with floating and push/glide skills. These are foundational, so careful progression is key.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

**Lesson Plan:**

*   **Focus:** Building water confidence and fundamental skills, with a focus on floating and push/glides for identified swimmers.
*   **Swimmers:** 10

*   **Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):**
    *   Welcome swimmers and parents/carers. Briefly explain today's goals: getting comfortable with floating and pushing.
    *   Reiterate pool rules and safe entry/exit.
*   **Warm-up (5-7 mins):**
    *   Gentle entry into the water.
    *   Splash games and blowing bubbles.

    *   **Floating Skills Focus:**
        *   **Drill 1 (Jacob Robbins focus):** On a large woggle or supported by the teacher, practice floating on front and back. Focus on relaxed body, then a gentle attempt to regain feet. Break down the movement of getting from float to standing. (This addresses Jacob's broad confidence issue).
        *   **Drill 2 (Peggy, Sara, Una focus):** Supported push and glide on front from the wall, encouraging a flat body and face in water. (This addresses their difficulties).
        *   **Drill 3 (Group):** "Watery Boat": Swimmers use woggles to support themselves and move around the shallow end, practicing gentle movements and changes of direction.
*   **Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):**
    *   **"Catch the floating ring":** Swimmers practice controlled movements to get to a floating ring and bring it back to a designated spot. This encourages controlled travel and reaching.
*   **Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):**
    *   Game of "Simon Says" with simple water-based actions (e.g., "Simon says blow bubbles," "Simon says clap your hands").
    *   Safe exit.
