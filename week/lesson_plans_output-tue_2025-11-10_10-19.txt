    *   Focus on log rolls from back to front and front to back.
    *   Start with supported rolls, focusing on head position and body control.
    *   Use woggles to help with buoyancy and body position.
    *   Break down the roll into smaller stages if needed.

**Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):**
*   **Tuck to Rotate (Isla-Mai Haywood, Mason Curtis, Mila Sosna, Scarlett Watts):**
    *   Perform a tuck to rotate from a flat floating position on the front to a back floating position, then return to standing.
    *   This builds on the floating and rotation skills.
    *   Provide visual demonstrations and verbal cues.

**Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):**
*   **Game:** "Seahorse Race" using woggles, encouraging movement and control.
*   Practice exiting the water without support.
*   Positive reinforcement for all attempts and progress.
