# 16:00 Stage 4

*   **My Analysis:** The main focus for this class will be reinforcing core Stage 4 skills, with particular attention to push and glide and leg actions. Ihechidere Mejeha and Leo Thornton are flagged as needing extra support with their push and glide and butterfly kick respectively. Albie Oldham, Harrison Waldron, Kieran Waldron, and Olivia Gwin are identified as needing significant development in their kicking and basic stroke technique, with 'Needs Practice' ratings across multiple kicking skills. Hridhika Harish needs focus on her push and glide. Daisy Manning, Maisie Skett, and Peyia Bell appear to have a good grasp of the current skills.
*   **Planning Method:** Top-and-Tailing

### Lesson Plan: Stage 4 (16:00)

*   **Class:** 16:00 Stage 4
*   **Method:** Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
*   **Focus:** Developing and reinforcing front crawl kick and push and glide.
*   **Swimmers:** 9
*   **Equipment:** Kickboards (1 per swimmer), woggles (1 per swimmer), sinking toys (for optional use).

**Introduction & Safety (5 mins)**
*   Welcome swimmers and briefly recap poolside safety rules.
*   Introduce the focus of the session: developing strong front crawl kicks and improving push and glide from the wall.
*   Quickly check that all swimmers are ready for the session.

**Warm-up (7 mins)**
*   **Activity:** "Animal Walks" on the poolside.
    *   Instructors call out animal names, and swimmers perform associated movements (e.g., frog jumps, crab walks, penguin walks). This is to get them moving and ready for water.
*   **In-water warm-up:**
    *   Sit on poolside, splash water.
    *   Safe entry.
    *   Hold onto poolside, kick legs with knees to wall, then stand up. Focus on a consistent flutter kick.
    *   "Monkey across pool" along the wall, reinforcing leg action.

**Main Activity (10 mins)**
*   **Focus:** Front crawl kick and push and glide.
*   **Activity 1: Kick with Kickboards (5 mins)**
    *   Swimmers use kickboards to practice front crawl kick across the pool.
    *   **Teaching Points:** Legs straight, floppy ankles, kick from the hips, keep knees slightly bent, try to "boil the water" with splashes initially. Ensure heads are in a good position (looking down/forward, not up).
    *   **Adaptation:** For Ihechidere, emphasize a strong push from the wall. For Albie, Harrison, Kieran, and Olivia, provide extra support and focus on basic leg action.
*   **Activity 2: Push and Glide (5 mins)**
    *   Swimmers push off the wall into a glide.
    *   **Teaching Points:** Push off the wall, arms stretched out in front, body straight, face down, looking towards the bottom.
    *   **Adaptation:** For Ihechidere, focus on a powerful push. For Albie, Harrison, Kieran, and Olivia, support them to achieve a basic glide with a straight body. Hridhika can focus on maintaining a straight body after the push.

**Contrast Activity (5 mins)**
*   **Activity:** "Woggle Challenge"
    *   Swimmers use woggles. They must sit on the woggle and move across the pool using their arms and legs, focusing on maintaining a streamlined body position. This is to provide a different movement challenge.
    *   **Adaptation:** For those struggling, provide extra support or encourage sculling with their hands.

**Cooldown & Fun (3 mins)**
*   **Activity:** "Toy Pick-Up"
    *   Sinking toys are placed in the shallow end. Swimmers retrieve toys, encouraging them to move through the water and collect items.
    *   **Focus:** A relaxed movement and a fun way to end the session.
*   Safe exit from the pool.
*   Positive reinforcement for effort and participation.

    *   Swimmers link a variety of skills together for a continuous 1 minute duration. This could include: front crawl with dolphin kick, backstroke with a scull, a tuck float, and a controlled rotation.
    *   **Teaching Points:** Focus on linking skills smoothly, maintaining momentum, and demonstrating coordination.
    *   **Adaptation:** For Jonathan, offer clear demonstration and breaking down the sequence. For Jessica and Teddy, encourage participation and focus on completing as much of the sequence as possible, rather than perfection. Neel and Samuel can help demonstrate or lead parts of the sequence.

**Contrast Activity (5 mins)**
*   **Activity:** "Obstacle Swim"
    *   A simple obstacle course is set up (e.g., swim through hoops, under a woggle bridge). Swimmers navigate the course using a choice of strokes.
    *   **Focus:** Reinforces swimming efficiency and introduces different ways to move through water.
    *   **Adaptation:** For Jessica and Teddy, encourage them to complete at least one element of the course, or provide support.

**Cooldown & Fun (3 mins)**
*   **Activity:** "Marco Polo" or a similar interactive game.
    *   Focus on teamwork and enjoyment.
*   Safe exit from the pool.
*   Positive feedback on effort and progress, particularly noting improvements in butterfly kick and movement sequences.
