--- [Processing: 16:00 Stage 7] ---
My Analysis:
No specific notes provided for tue.
Note: Indiana needs more practice on movement sequence, which will affect her ability to learn other skills. Xander has multiple "Needs Practice" areas (movement sequence, 50/100m swims), suggesting a blocker in overall stamina and stroke efficiency. Ella and Oscar need attention on Breaststroke and Tread Water. Thomas also needs work on movement sequence. Irena and Sam have achieved almost all skills and will require challenge.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

Class: 16:00 Stage 7 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing advanced aquatic skills, including movement sequences, surface dives, and stroke efficiency for varied abilities.
Swimmers: 8
Equipment: Kickboards, Woggles, Sinking Rings, Hoops, Pull Buoys (for advanced challenge)

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   Welcome swimmers to Stage 7. Quick safety reminder: listen to instructions, no running on poolside, wait for turn. (Reference `SWIMTEACHV3` page 54 on Command Language for clear instructions).
*   Discuss the importance of dynamic movement and flow in swimming.
*   Briefly outline the session: a mix of skill practice and movement challenges.

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   **Dynamic Stretches (on poolside):** Arm circles (forwards/backwards), leg swings, torso twists.
*   **In-water warm-up:** Gentle 25m Front Crawl (focus on long body line), followed by 25m Backstroke (focus on smooth arm recovery).
*   **"Unconventional Drill" (Technique 4) - Flowing Fish:** Swimmers push and glide from the wall, focusing on maintaining a streamlined position and making their body "flow like a wave" (Reference `SWIMTEACHV3` page 43 on Butterfly Undulation for imagery). Repeat 2-3 times.

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Skill 1: Movement Sequences & Rotation (Stage 7, Skill 5 focus for Indiana, Thomas, Ella, Oscar, Xander):**
    *   **Station 1 (Deep End - Advanced Group: Irena, Sam, Oliver, Harvey):** Practice `Surface Dive Progression` (Technique 3). Perform a head-first surface dive, retrieve a sinking ring from the bottom, then scull feet-first back to the surface. Focus on controlled entry and efficient sculling. (Reference `SWIMTEACHV3` page 48 for Open Turn principles of head-first dive, and Stage 7 skill 10 for sculling headfirst).
    *   **Station 2 (Mid-Lane - Developing Group: Ella, Oscar, Indiana, Thomas, Xander, Alwin, Layan, Rewan, Tadhg, Edmund):** Work on linking skills for movement sequences. Use woggles to support "Spaceships" (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 42). Scull out on back, tuck up into "tub" position, turn completely around, stretch out and scull back to "base". Progress to doing without woggles. This addresses rotation, sculling and floating for Indiana, Thomas, Ella, Oscar, Xander.
    *   **Top-and-Tailing Rotation:** Swimmers rotate between stations, ensuring continuous engagement. Advanced group practices surface dives, while developing group focuses on varied movements and sculling.

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **Stroke Efficiency & Stamina (For Xander, Ella, Oscar):**
    *   **"Backstroke Legs" (Technique 2) Drill with Kickboard:** Swimmers perform 25m Backstroke legs only, holding a kickboard at arm's length. Focus on continuous, strong kicks (Reference `SWIMTEACHV3` page 35 on common mistake: poor kick, emphasizes strong, effective kick). Emphasize keeping hips high and a stable head position (addressing potential "vampire neck" from `SWIMTEACHV3` page 35).
    *   **Breaststroke Pull-Buoy Swim (for Ella, Oscar, Alwin):** 25m Breaststroke using a pull buoy between legs, focusing purely on arm action and rhythmic breathing. Coach "11, Eat, 11, Breathe, 11" arm rhythm (Reference `SWIMTEACHV3` page 38).

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   **"Stanley's Treasure" (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 41):** Split into two teams. Teacher calls two names to race for a sinking toy in the middle. Focus on participation and fun.
*   Review key learnings and praise effort. Encourage safe exit.

--- [Processing: 16:30 Stage 2] ---
My Analysis:
No specific notes provided for tue.
Note: Alfie and Scarlett are struggling with floating and log rolls, indicating a fear of inverting or being in different positions in the water. Isla-Mai, Mason, and Mila also need more practice on various log roll and tuck rotation skills. Focus should be on building confidence through supported rolls and emphasizing head position. Willow is highly competent and can assist.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

Class: 16:30 Stage 2 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Building confidence and skill in rotation, floating, and log rolls, particularly for those hesitant with inversions.
Swimmers: 6
Equipment: Woggles (flexi beams/water noodles), Small floating toys (e.g., egg flips, plastic ducks), Kickboards.

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   Welcome the children. Quick review of poolside rules (no running, listening to teacher). (Reference `SWIMTEACHV3` page 54 on Command Language for clear instructions).
*   Introduce the idea of being "super flexible" in the water today!

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   **"Bean Game" (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 41):** Call out different "beans" for movement (Running bean, Jumping bean, Chilli bean - shiver, Broad bean - wide shape/float, Baked bean - curled up/tuck float). This encourages movement and different body shapes.
*   **"Motorbike/Pretzel Woggle" (Technique 1):** Swimmers sit on woggles, holding ends like handlebars, kicking legs to move around the pool. Encourage gentle turns and splashes. (Reference `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 4 for woggles as "motorbikes" and page 42 for "Sea-horses" activity).

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Skill 1: Supported Log Rolls (Stage 2, Skills 11 & 12 focus for Alfie, Scarlett, Isla-Mai, Mason, Mila):**
    *   **Activity 1: Front to Back Log Roll:** Swimmers push off from the wall on their front (with or without kickboard, optional woggle under arms), glide, and then gently roll onto their back, aiming to look at the ceiling. Teacher provides hands-on support at the hip or shoulder to guide the roll, especially for Alfie and Scarlett (Reference `SWIMTEACHV3` page 14 on "Body line" for back glides, emphasizing minimal head support and letting swimmer lift body).
    *   **Activity 2: Back to Front Log Roll:** Swimmers push off on their back, glide, and then gently roll onto their front, blowing bubbles. Reinforce looking down into the water.
    *   **Progression:** Start with teacher support, then reduce support as confidence grows. For Willow, encourage independent rolls for longer distances.
    *   **Top-and-Tailing Rotation:** Swimmers perform rolls from wall to a designated mid-point, then return to the wall, allowing for individual feedback on each attempt.

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **Floating & Tuck Rotations (Stage 2, Skills 3, 9 & 10 focus for Alfie, Scarlett, Mason, Mila):**
    *   **"Pretzel Float" (Technique 1):** From a standing position, encourage tucking knees to chest and hugging them, trying to float in a small ball shape. Progress to rotating from front to back in the tuck position.
    *   **"Eggs for Breakfast" (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 42):** Swimmers lie on their backs (woggle optional for support), egg flips in the center. On "Eggs for breakfast!", they rotate forward to grasp an egg, then rotate back to lie on their backs. This is a fun way to practice front-to-back rotation and confidence.
    *   For Alfie and Scarlett, focus on gentle, playful encouragement and positive reinforcement during these activities.

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   **"Bubble Blowing Race" (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 3):** Using egg flips or plastic ducks, have children blow them across a short distance. Emphasizes rhythmic breathing and mouth/nose submersion (Stage 2, Skill 3).
*   Praise all efforts, especially for attempts at new positions. Safe exit.

    *   **"Unconventional Drill" (Technique 4) - Dolphin Wiggles:** For Edmund, use "Dolphin Wiggles" (`SWIMTEACHV3` page 42) with a kickboard, focusing on the undulating body motion. Advanced swimmers (Molly, Jarryd, Harvey, Benjamin) can practice 25m Butterfly kick in streamline without a board.
    *   **"Surface Dive Progression" (Technique 3):** Perform pike or tuck surface dives to retrieve sinking rings (Stage 6, Skill 11). For Edmund and Thomas, ensure they are comfortable with submersion first. For Layan, focus on smooth entry and control. (Reference `SWIMTEACHV3` page 48 for Open Turn steps, which involve head stability and underwater movement).

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   **"Catch Me" (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 43):** Swimmers stand in a circle. Teacher calls two names, they swim to catch each other. (Ensures all are engaged).
*   Quick recap of what was learned and achieved. Praise individual efforts. Safe exit.

--- [Processing: 17:30 Stage 5] ---
My Analysis:
No specific notes provided for tue.
Note: Audrey, Jai, and Phoebe have "Needs Practice" or "Fair" in sculling activities (stationary, feet-first, sequence), treading water, and the H.E.L.P position. Audrey also needs significant work on Breaststroke and Butterfly. Opal needs to refine Butterfly and sculling sequence. Sculling and safety skills are foundational for this stage.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

Class: 17:30 Stage 5 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing sculling proficiency, treading water using eggbeater, and introducing the H.E.L.P. position, with basic Butterfly kick.
Swimmers: 4
Equipment: Kickboards, Woggles, Sinking Rings, Pull Buoys.

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   Welcome the class to Stage 5. Briefly review water safety principles and the importance of being able to help themselves (e.g., getting help action - Stage 5, Skill 12). (Reference `SWIMTEACHV3` page 54 on Command Language for clear instructions).
*   Outline the session: focusing on hands for sculling, treading water, and a new safety position.

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   **"Seahorse Race" (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 41):** Swimmers sit on woggles and use their arms and legs to paddle across a short distance. This promotes arm and leg movement and builds comfort with buoyancy.
*   **Floating Game (Stage 5, Skill 3):** Practice various floating positions (star float, tuck float, mushroom float) for 3 seconds each. Focus on relaxation and breath control. (Reference `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 42 for "Eggs for Breakfast" rotation to practice different floats).

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Skill 1: Sculling & Treading Water (Stage 5, Skills 1, 2, 3, 4 focus for Audrey, Jai, Phoebe, Opal):**
    *   **Activity 1: Stationary & Feet-First Sculling (Audrey, Jai, Phoebe):** Swimmers perform a flat stationary scull on their back (Stage 5, Skill 1). Progress to feet-first sculling for 5 metres (Stage 5, Skill 2). Focus on small, controlled hand movements to generate propulsion.
    *   **Activity 2: Sculling Sequence & Treading Water (Opal, Jai, Phoebe, Audrey):** Practice a sculling sequence (e.g., head first, then feet first, incorporating a log roll rotation) for 30 seconds (Stage 5, Skill 3). Integrate this into treading water (Stage 5, Skill 4), initially holding onto a woggle, then independently using an eggbeater leg action.
    *   **"Unconventional Drill" (Technique 4) - Water Wheels (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 42):** Using woggles around their backs, students scull or paddle out, turn completely around in a circle, continue to scull to the other side. This is excellent for sculling, paddle action, and rotation.
    *   **Top-and-Tailing Rotation:** Swimmers perform sculling drills from wall to mid-lane, then return, receiving targeted feedback on hand position and body stability.

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **Skill 2: H.E.L.P. Position & Basic Butterfly Kick (Stage 5, Skill 14 focus for Audrey, Jai, Phoebe; Skill 9 for Audrey, Opal):**
    *   **H.E.L.P. Position Practice:** Introduce and practice the Heat Escape Lessening Position (H.E.L.P. Position - Stage 5, Skill 14). Emphasize holding still and conserving energy. Provide specific feedback for Audrey and Jai to refine this.
    *   **Basic Butterfly Kick (Audrey, Opal):** Introduction to Butterfly basic kick using a kickboard. Focus on the undulating movement from the chest (Reference `SWIMTEACHV3` page 42 on Butterfly Kick "Undulation" and "Dolphin Wiggles").

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   **"Sinking Treasure Hunt":** Scatter sinking rings or dive sticks (Stage 5, Skill 8) in the shallow end. Swimmers retrieve them with good push and glide technique.
*   Praise all swimmers for their efforts in new skills and confidence building. Safe exit.
