Swimmers: 8
Equipment: Kickboards, Pull buoys, Woggles, Dive sticks/Rings, Cones/Markers

Introduction & Safety (4 mins):
*   **Welcome & Rules:** Briefly introduce lesson objectives, emphasizing safety in a single lane (no running, awareness of others, designated entry/exit). Discuss safe diving/entry procedures.
*   **Warm-up Swim:** 25m choice of stroke, focusing on smooth entry from the wall. Reinforce streamline push-off.
*   **Ability Grouping:** Swimmers will naturally split, with stronger swimmers (Sam, Thomas, Oliver, Indiana) at one end (deep/diving end if available) and less confident swimmers (Evelyn, Ella, Oscar, Xander) at the other (shallow end or mid-lane).

Warm-up (6 mins):
*   **Lane 1 (Stronger):** 4 x 25m Front Crawl with focus on consistent breathing pattern (e.g., 3-stroke breathing). Emphasise efficient body roll (SEQRESOURCE.pdf - "Stanley 7: Lesson Plan 1" mentions front crawl arm work with breathing to side).
*   **Lane 2 (Less Confident):**
    *   2 x 25m Kickboard Front Crawl legs, face in water, blowing bubbles. Focus on strong, continuous flutter kick (SWIMTEACHV3.pdf - "Flutter Kick" section for floppy ankles and constant kick).
    *   2 x 25m Kickboard Backstroke legs, eyes looking up. Use "Backstroke Legs" technique (SWIMTEACHV3.pdf - "Backstroke Arms" section mentions body straight, near surface).
*   **Combined:** "Shark" game (SEQRESOURCE.pdf, p.41) - Teacher as shark, swimmers move to the other side of the lane when "shark's hungry" to get heart rates up.

Main Activity (11 mins):
*   **Skill 5: Movement Sequence (Indiana, Evelyn, Ella, Oscar, Xander focus):**
    *   **Part A (Less Confident - Shallow/Mid-Lane):** Breakdown the sequence into smaller skills (e.g., sculling head first for 5m, log roll front to back, then tuck float to standing). Use Woggles for support if needed. (SEQRESOURCE.pdf - "Stanley 7: Lesson Plan 2" introduces Dolphin leg kick, which is part of a movement sequence).
        *   **Unconventional Drill:** "Human Submarine" - Scull feet first along the bottom (if shallow enough) or just above, then transition to a tucked log roll and return to sculling.
    *   **Part B (Stronger - Deep End/Mid-Lane):** Practice a full movement sequence: sitting dive -> 3 underwater dolphin kicks -> scull head first for 5m -> somersault forward rotation -> tuck float -> tread water (eggbeater) for 10s, incorporating sculling, rotation, and floating skills (SEQL2TEACHING.pdf - Core Aquatic Skills mentions dives, somersaults).
        *   **Surface Dive Progression (Technique 3):** Incorporate a surface dive at the beginning or end of their sequence.
*   **Butterfly Refinement (Ella, Evelyn, Oscar, Xander focus):**
    *   **Top-and-Tailing Drill:** Stronger swimmers practice 4 x 15m Butterfly kick in streamline with kickboard, focusing on chest press and undulating body (SWIMTEACHV3.pdf - "Butterfly Kick" section: "Undulation = the wave"). Less confident swimmers practice 4 x 10m Butterfly kick on front with a woggle under arms, focusing on keeping feet together.
    *   **Feedback:** Provide targeted feedback on hip drive and timing (SWIMTEACHV3.pdf - "Butterfly Kick" section).

Contrast Activity (5 mins):
*   **Obstacle Course (Evelyn focus, Skill 10):** Set up 2-3 hoops/woggles (as tunnels) across the lane. Swimmers push and glide through one, surface to breathe, then perform a log roll, then push and glide through another. Encourage continuous movement.
*   **Dive & Retrieve:** Practice sitting dives (or standing dives for more confident) at the deep end, then retrieve dive sticks/rings from the bottom. Focus on controlled entry and streamlined glide underwater. (SEQRESOURCE.pdf - "Stanley 7: Lesson Plan 1" mentions push and glide through hoop to pick up a submersible).

Cooldown & Fun (4 mins):
*   **Free Play/Choice:** Allow swimmers to choose an activity (e.g., practice a favorite stroke, play with woggles, or retrieve rings).
*   **Stretch & Chat:** Gentle arm and leg stretches on the wall. Ask swimmers what they enjoyed or what they want to improve next time. Reinforce good behavior and effort.
*   **Safe Exit:** Review safe exit procedures from the pool.

*   **Skill 1 (Stage 10): 1600m Set / Skill 2 (Stage 9): 800m Continuous (Sofia, Amara, Daniel, Erin focus):**
    *   **Top-and-Tailing:**
        *   **Less Confident (Sofia, Amara, Daniel, Erin):** Focus on sustained swimming for 100m or 200m continuously, choice of stroke. Teacher provides pacing cues.
        *   **Stronger:** Practice 4 x 200m on a set turnaround time (e.g., 4 mins), focusing on maintaining pace and technique (SEQRESOURCE.pdf - "Stanley 8").

Contrast Activity (5 mins):
*   **Relay Takeovers (Isabella, Erin focus):**
    *   **Part A (Shallow End/Side of Lane):** Demonstrate and practice Front Crawl relay takeovers (incoming and outgoing swimmer). Focus on timing the entry and exit effectively. Use cones as relay partners.
    *   **Part B (Deep End):** Practice Front Crawl relay takeovers with a push-off from the wall, focusing on the dive entry and streamlined start.
*   **"Stanley's Treasure" (SEQRESOURCE.pdf, p.41):** Split into two teams. Teacher throws a dive brick/ring (treasure) into the middle. Two designated swimmers from opposite teams race to retrieve it without being tagged by the other. This promotes speed and spatial awareness.

Cooldown & Fun (2 mins):
*   **Fun Challenge:** 1 x 25m "Build a Race" where swimmers can swim any stroke or combination, but must finish strong.
*   **Review & Praise:** Gather at the wall for a quick debrief. Highlight improvements in IM transitions and underwater kicks.
*   **Safe Exit:** All exit the water safely.
