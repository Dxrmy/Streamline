## 16:00 Stage 7

*   **Indiana Marrow:** Has consistently been marked as "Needs Practice" on "Perform a movement sequence (linking skills with strokes & sculls)" for the last two weeks. This suggests a difficulty in integrating and coordinating multiple skills simultaneously. This is a **priority** to address.
*   **Evelyn Sones:** Shows "Fair" or "Not assessed" across several key skills like Front Crawl, Butterfly, and the movement sequence. This indicates a potential broader difficulty in stroke development and aquatic coordination. This needs focused attention to build confidence and competence.
*   **Ella Harris:** While strong in most areas, her "Breaststroke" has moved from "Good" to "Fair" in the most recent report. The "Movement sequence" is also "Not assessed". This could indicate a lapse in technique for breaststroke, or a lack of opportunity to practice the more complex movement sequence.

## 16:30 Stage 2

*   **Hollie Russell:** Is consistently marked as "Needs Practice" or "Not assessed" across multiple foundational skills including "Move from a flat floating position on the front", "Push from wall and glide on the back", and both "tuck to rotate" skills. This is a significant **foundational blocker**. The difficulty in transitioning between floating positions and standing suggests a lack of water confidence or core body control. This needs to be the absolute **primary focus**.
*   **Edith Collinson:** Shows "Needs Practice" on "Move from a flat floating position on the back" and "log roll from the back to the front". This indicates a struggle with maintaining balance and control while on her back, which is crucial for building confidence and progressing to other skills.
*   **Alfie Hudspith:** Has regressed on "log roll from the back to the front" from "Good" to "Fair" and is "Needs Practice" on "log roll from the front to the back". This suggests a potential inconsistency in his rotational skills, which are important for body awareness in the water.

## 17:00 Stage 6

*   **Daniel Jobi:** Is marked as "Needs Practice" or "Not assessed" on multiple skills including "Push and glide and swim Front Crawl", and "Perform a 'shout and signal' rescue". His overall progress of 36% indicates he is significantly behind his peers. The lack of assessment in key areas is concerning and suggests he may be hesitant to attempt these skills. This requires immediate and targeted support.
*   **Edmund Tucker:** Has shown regression in "Push and glide and swim Front Crawl" from "Good" to "Not assessed" and "Push and glide and swim 25 metres, choice of stroke is optional" is "Needs Practice". This suggests a recent dip in performance or confidence in freestyle and general swimming ability.
*   **Alwin Varughese:** Has "Needs Practice" on "Push and glide and swim Breaststroke" which is a slight regression from previous reports where it was "Pass". While not a critical blocker, it indicates a need for focused practice to maintain consistency.

## 17:30 Stage 5

*   **Jason Lawrence Bridgart:** Is consistently marked as "Needs Practice" or "Not assessed" across a significant number of skills, including "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Backstroke", "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Breaststroke", and "Perform a feet first sculling action for 5 metres in a flat position on the back". His overall progress of 52% is low, indicating he is struggling with core Stage 5 competencies. The lack of assessment in many areas suggests a potential avoidance of these skills. This requires a comprehensive review of his confidence and technique.
*   **Nina Bies:** Shows "Needs Practice" on "Perform a flat stationary scull on the back", "Perform a feet first sculling action for 5 metres in a flat position on the back", and "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Breaststroke". These are fundamental skills for Stage 5, and her struggles indicate a potential issue with body position and coordinated movements.
*   **Leon Gratkowski:** Is marked as "Needs Practice" on "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Breaststroke" and "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Butterfly basic stroke", and "FL Attempt a sitting dive". The breaststroke and butterfly struggles suggest difficulty with the specific leg and arm actions required for these strokes, while the sitting dive indicates a confidence issue with entering the water from a height.

## 18:00 Stage 5

*   **Alexander Southall:** Is marked "Needs Practice" on "Demonstrate an action for getting help" and "FL Demonstrate the H.E.L.P Position". While his swimming skills are strong, these safety-related skills are crucial and need to be reinforced.
*   **Asher Philip Ashok:** Shows "Needs Practice" on "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Backstroke", "Demonstrate an action for getting help", and "FL Demonstrate the H.E.L.P Position". His regression in backstroke is concerning and, coupled with the safety skill deficits, indicates a need for focused intervention on both swimming technique and water safety awareness.
*   **Ava Hancock:** Is marked "Needs Practice" on "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Butterfly basic stroke", "Perform a handstand and hold for a minimum of 3 seconds", and "FL Demonstrate the H.E.L.P Position". The butterfly skill deficit suggests difficulty with the coordinated arm and leg movements, and the handstand/HELP position deficits point to a need for greater body control and water safety knowledge.

## 18:30 Stage 8

*   **Sofia Oettle Lalupu:** Has "Needs Practice" on "Complete a set lasting 1600m" and "Swim 1500m continuously choosing one stroke". This indicates a significant stamina and pacing issue, which is a core requirement for Stage 10 (which this class appears to be geared towards). This needs to be a **priority** for endurance development.
*   **Amara Tilley:** Shows "Fair" on "Swim 800m continuously choosing one stroke" and "Perform a 15m underwater kick on front". Her overall progress of 22% is very low. This suggests she is struggling with the endurance and technical elements required at this higher stage. A significant focus on building stamina and refining technique is needed.
*   **Elin Bidwell:** Is "Needs Practice" on "Swim a continuous 200m Individual Medley using recognised turns". While her longer sets are "Good", the IM indicates a potential weakness in coordinating the different strokes within a continuous swim. This is a common area of difficulty and should be addressed with specific IM drills.

**Note:** The Stage 8 class seems to be a mixture of Stage 8, 9 and 10 skills. The analysis has focused on students who show clear struggle relative to the stage indicated for the class.
