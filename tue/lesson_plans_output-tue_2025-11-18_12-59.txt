*   25m backstroke kick with kickboard for body position (using "Backstroke Legs" technique for a strong, consistent kick). (Oscar, Ella, Rewan focus on strong, narrow kick).
*   Introduce "Unconventional Drills": "Shark Attack" - swimmers swim freely, on teacher's call "Shark!", they must freeze in a strong, streamlined float (front or back). This encourages quick transitions and body control.
*   Evelyn to attempt various stroke kicks (FC, BS, BR) with a kickboard for initial assessment.

Main Activity (10-12 mins): Perform a Movement Sequence (Skill 5) & Breaststroke/Eggbeater refinement.
*   **Tier 1 (Needs Practice: Indiana, Thomas, Xander, Oliver - on Skill 5):**
    *   Break down Skill 5 (Movement Sequence): Practice components first.
    *   **Activity 1: Sculling & Rotation Stations.** Set up 3-4 stations along the lane.
        *   Station A (Sculling - head first/feet first): Swimmers scull 5m, focus on hand/arm action for propulsion. (Nina, Audrey, Jason practice flat stationary/feet first scull).
        *   Station B (Rotation - forward/backward somersault log roll): Practice log rolls from front to back, then back to front.
        *   Station C (Floating - tuck float/star float): Hold different floats for 5 seconds.
    *   Swimmers rotate through stations, focusing on mastering each component. Irena and Sam can demonstrate and provide peer feedback.
    *   Progression: Link 2-3 components (e.g., scull, then tuck float, then log roll).
*   **Tier 2 (Fair: Ella, Oscar - on Breaststroke & Eggbeater):**
    *   **Activity 2: Breaststroke Kick & Eggbeater Drills.**
    *   While Tier 1 rotates, Ella and Oscar work on:
