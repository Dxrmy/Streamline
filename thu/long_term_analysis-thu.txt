## 16:00 Stage 6

*   **David Patras:** Has been consistently marked "Fair" for "Sink, push off on side from the wall, glide, kick, and rotate into Backstroke." for the past two weeks. This suggests a difficulty in coordinating the full sequence. Recommend breaking this down into individual components (sink, push, glide, kick, rotate) and practising them separately before combining.
*   **Marshall Mills:** Showed no progress on "Push and glide and swim Front Crawl to include at least six rhythmical breaths" and "Push and glide and swim 25 metres, choice of stroke is optional". This is a significant concern as these are fundamental skills for Stage 6. The lack of progress suggests a potential issue with confidence or a foundational weakness in body position or propulsion. Focus on drills that build core strength and streamline.

## 16:30 Stage 1

*   **Burhan Badri:** Has been consistently marked "Needs Practice" for "Push and glide in a flat position on the back from a wall" across the observed weeks. This indicates a potential issue with body tension or a fear of letting go fully. Focus on assisted back floats and gradual release of support.
*   **George Beech:** "Push and glide in a flat position on the back from a wall" has been marked "Needs Practice" for two consecutive weeks. This suggests a difficulty maintaining a flat position. Practice exercises to promote a horizontal body position, such as supported glides with arms extended.
*   **Harvey Cave:** Similarly, "Push and glide in a flat position on the back from a wall" is marked "Needs Practice". The pattern here with George and Harvey suggests a potential group-wide challenge with this skill. Reinforce buoyancy and body alignment drills.
*   **Reggie Hodgkins:** "Push and glide in a flat position on the back from a wall" has also been marked "Needs Practice" for two consecutive weeks. This reinforces the observation of a potential group weakness in this skill, indicating a need for targeted practice.
*   **Sasha Duddell:** Has consistently received "Needs Practice" for "Push and glide in a flat position on the back from a wall" and "Push and glide in a flat position on the front from a wall". This dual difficulty suggests a fundamental issue with the glide phase, potentially related to body tension or entering the water correctly. Focus on a controlled entry and maintaining a streamlined shape.

## 17:00 Stage 1

*   **Bella Grace Kembo:** "Move from a flat floating position on the back and return to standing" and "Move from a flat floating position on the front and return to standing" are both marked "Needs Practice". This indicates a struggle with dynamic movement and regaining an upright position independently. Focus on drills that build confidence in shifting weight and recovering to standing.
*   **Ellie Griffiths:** "Push and glide in a flat position on the front from a wall" has been marked "Needs Practice" for two consecutive weeks. This suggests a potential lack of propulsion or incorrect body position during the glide. Review leg kick and streamline techniques.
*   **Jacob Robbins:** Shows a consistent pattern of "Needs Practice" for "Move from a flat floating position on the front and return to standing", "Push and glide in a flat position on the front from a wall", and "Push and glide in a flat position on the back from a wall". This indicates significant challenges with both front and back glides and the ability to recover to standing. Prioritise mastering the push and glide on the front, followed by the recovery, as this is a more immediate need.
*   **Peggy Thorpe:** "Move from a flat floating position on the back and return to standing", "Move from a flat floating position on the front and return to standing", and "Push and glide in a flat position on the front from a wall", and "Push and glide in a flat position on the back from a wall" are all marked "Needs Practice". This broad difficulty across fundamental skills requires a foundational review of body position and propulsion.
*   **Sara Stenmark:** "Move from a flat floating position on the back and return to standing", "Move from a flat floating position on the front and return to standing", and "Push and glide in a flat position on the front from a wall" are all marked "Needs Practice". This indicates challenges with both floating recovery and the front glide.
*   **Una Earlam:** Similar to Sara, Una struggles with "Move from a flat floating position on the back and return to standing", "Move from a flat floating position on the front and return to standing", and "Push and glide in a flat position on the front from a wall". The repeated "Needs Practice" across these core skills points to a need for focused, repetitive practice on maintaining buoyancy and streamlining.

## 17:30 Stage 4

*   **Arabella Wilson:** All skills are marked "Not assessed" in the latest report. This is a significant concern and suggests a complete lack of engagement or participation in the assessed skills. This needs immediate investigation to understand the barrier to participation.
*   **Duaa Azam:** Has consistently been marked "Needs Practice" for "Perform a sequence of changing shapes (minimum of 3) whilst floating flat at the surface & demonstrate and understanding of floating" and "Perform a head first sculling action for 5 metres in a flat position on the back". This suggests a lack of confidence or control in water, and a difficulty with basic water manipulation. Focus on building confidence with water and developing fundamental sculling movements.
*   **Fabian Lockley:** Similar to Duaa, Fabian is consistently marked "Needs Practice" for "Perform a sequence of changing shapes (minimum of 3) whilst floating flat at the surface & demonstrate and understanding of floating" and "Perform a head first sculling action for 5 metres in a flat position on the back". This indicates a potential group-wide issue with body control and water confidence. Prioritise drills that build a secure floating position and introduce sculling in a supported manner.
*   **Myah Jackson:** "Push and glide from the wall towards the pool floor" has been marked "Needs Practice" for two consecutive weeks. This suggests an issue with generating power from the wall or maintaining a streamlined body shape. Focus on exercises that improve push-off power and streamline.
*   **Rupert Geoghegan:** "Perform a head first sculling action for 5 metres in a flat position on the back" has been marked "Needs Practice" and "Travel on the front and log roll in one continuous movement onto the back" is also "Needs Practice". This indicates challenges with dynamic water movement and coordination. Focus on breaking down the log roll and practising sculling with clear instruction on hand and arm movements.
*   **Shawn Kendrick:** "Perform a head first sculling action for 5 metres in a flat position on the back" has been marked "Needs Practice" for two consecutive weeks. This reinforces the observation of a group-wide challenge with sculling.

## 18:00 Stage 5

*   **Amelia Ishaq:** Has shown a consistent "Needs Practice" for "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Breaststroke" across the last two reports. This suggests a fundamental issue with the breaststroke timing or coordination. Focus on drills isolating the breaststroke kick and pull, ensuring correct timing.
*   **Halle Jackson:** "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Butterfly basic stroke" and "Perform a forward somersault" are both marked "Needs Practice". The butterfly stroke requires specific coordination and power, while the somersault requires spatial awareness and comfort in inversion. Consider separate practice sessions for these skills, focusing on technique.
*   **Leon Gratkowski:** "Perform a flat stationary scull on the back", "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Breaststroke", "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Butterfly basic stroke", and "FL Attempt a sitting dive" are all marked "Needs Practice". This indicates a broad range of difficulties, particularly with dynamic skills and independent water movement. Prioritise mastering the flat stationary scull and then build upon this with guided practice of the other skills.
*   **Noah Peet:** Multiple skills, including "Perform a sculling sequence with a partner", "Tread water for 30 seconds", "Perform 3 different shaped jumps into deep water", "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Breaststroke", "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Butterfly basic stroke", "FL Attempt a sitting dive", and "FL Demonstrate the H.E.L.P Position" are marked "Needs Practice". This suggests a significant gap in foundational water skills and confidence. Focus on building comfort in deeper water and practising tread water and basic sculling.
*   **Parker Campbell-Jone:** "Perform a sculling sequence with a partner for 30-45 seconds to include a rotation" has been marked "Needs Practice" for two consecutive weeks. This indicates a difficulty coordinating with a partner and executing rotations. This needs to be addressed to progress to more complex water safety skills.
*   **Rosie Cotterill:** "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Butterfly basic stroke" and "FL Attempt a sitting dive" are marked "Needs Practice". These are advanced skills that require specific coordination and confidence. Break down the butterfly stroke into its component parts and work on drills that build confidence for the sitting dive.
*   **Sebastian Gaskell:** "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Backstroke" has been marked "Needs Practice" for two consecutive weeks. This is a key Stage 5 skill and its persistent "Needs Practice" status suggests an issue with the backstroke technique, possibly related to body position or arm pull.
*   **Willow Tindell:** "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Breaststroke" and "Push and glide and swim 10 metres Butterfly basic stroke" are marked "Needs Practice". This points to a consistent challenge with these two strokes. Focus on reinforcing the fundamental mechanics of each stroke separately.

## 18:30 Stage 8

*   **Alice Harper:** "Swim 100 metres in less than three minutes using any stroke" is marked "Needs Practice". This indicates a stamina or pacing issue. Recommend interval training to improve pace endurance.
*   **Alvin Parsons:** "Swim 800m continuously choosing one stroke", "Perform a Backstroke start then Butterfly kick in a streamlined position underwater up to a max of 15m from the wall, transfer into stroke and complete the remainder of the 25m", "Perform a Front Crawl start, underwater kick in a streamlined position until a minimum of 15m from the wall is completed, transfer into stroke and complete remainder of the 25m", and "Perform a Breaststroke start, perform a legal underwater 1.5 pull and transition stroke, then transfer into full stroke and complete the remainder of the 25m" are all marked "Needs Practice". This indicates significant challenges with endurance, underwater kicking consistency, and transition skills. Prioritise improving the 800m swim and then break down the underwater kicking and transitions into smaller, manageable drills.
*   **Elsie Telford:** "Swim 100 metres in less than three minutes using any stroke" and "Tread water for two minutes with one hand behind the back" are both marked "Needs Practice". This suggests a need for improved endurance and comfort in a more challenging treading water scenario. Focus on stamina-building activities and increasing the duration of treading water drills.
*   **Ethan Rouse:** "Swim 800m continuously choosing one stroke" and "Perform a Front Crawl start, underwater kick in a streamlined position until a minimum of 15m from the wall is completed, transfer into stroke and complete remainder of the 25m" are marked "Needs Practice". This points to a lack of endurance in longer swims and inconsistent underwater kicking technique off the start. Recommend longer continuous swims and dedicated drills for Front Crawl starts and underwater kicking.
*   **Florence Squires-Clark:** "Perform a Front Crawl start, underwater kick in a streamlined position until a minimum of 15m from the wall is completed, transfer into stroke and complete remainder of the 25m" is marked "Needs Practice". This suggests an issue with the Front Crawl start and the subsequent underwater phase. Focus on improving the streamlined position and consistent leg kick off the start.
*   **Gen Glenholmes:** "Perform a dive track or grab start, and kick butterfly underwater in a streamlined position for 5 meters with the focus on progressing it to the 10m" is marked "Needs Practice". This indicates a difficulty in initiating the Butterfly kick from a start and maintaining streamline. Focus on the body position and leg action for the Butterfly kick.
*   **Isaac Roberts:** "Complete a set lasting 800m on a specific times turn around set by coach" is marked "Fair", and "Swim a continuous 100m IM" is also "Fair". However, "Perform a Front Crawl start, underwater kick in a streamlined position until a minimum of 15m from the wall is completed, transfer into stroke and complete remainder of the 25m" is marked "Needs Practice". This suggests a specific issue with the Front Crawl start and underwater phase, despite reasonable performance in other endurance and IM tasks.
*   **Isla Webb:** All kicking drills ("Push & streamline, kick 25m Backstroke", "Push & streamline, kick 25m Breaststroke", "Push & streamline, kick 25m Butterfly", "Push & streamline, kick 25m Front crawl") are marked "Needs Practice". This indicates a significant weakness across all stroke kicks. Prioritise dedicated kick sets focusing on power and technique for each stroke.
*   **Jack Taylor:** "Swim 400m continuously using one stroke" is "Fair", and the turns for Breaststroke and Butterfly are "Needs Practice". This suggests a lack of consistent pacing in his 400m swim and difficulty executing legal turns for Breaststroke and Butterfly. Focus on drills that improve turn execution for these strokes.
*   **Jessica White:** "Perform a Backstroke turn from 10m in to 15m out" and "Perform a Butterfly turn from 10m in to 15m out" are both marked "Needs Practice". Additionally, "Perform a dive track or grab start, and kick butterfly underwater in a streamlined position for 5 meters" is also "Needs Practice". This indicates specific issues with turns and the Butterfly start/underwater phase. Focus on correct body rotation for the Backstroke turn and powerful leg drive for the Butterfly start.
*   **Oscar Lines:** "Swim 400m continuously using one stroke" is marked "Fair". "Perform a dive track or grab start, and kick butterfly underwater in a streamlined position for 5 meters with the focus on progressing it to the 10m" is marked "Needs Practice". This suggests a gap in sustained swimming endurance and a specific challenge with the Butterfly start and underwater kick.
