My Analysis
Note: No specific notes were provided for this class this week.
Note: Historically, David Patras showed difficulty with Backstroke rotation (Skill 2), but the current report shows 'Good' for this. Marshall Mills previously showed no progress on Front Crawl with rhythmical breaths and 25m optional swim; the current report shows 'Pass' for FC with breaths but 'Fair' for the 25m swim, and 'Fair' for Breaststroke and Surface Dive. This indicates a persistent need to address his overall swimming proficiency and confidence for distance.
The current report highlights several key skill gaps:
*   **Beginners (Arriyan, Lucy):** Both have significant 'Needs Practice' across all four strokes with breathing (FC, BS, BR), 25m optional swim, and surface dives. They also need to understand preparation for exercise.
*   **Widespread Skill Gaps:**
    *   **Breaststroke with rhythmical breaths (Skill 7):** 'Needs Practice' for Arriyan, Lucy. 'Fair' for Marshall, David, Fletcher, George, Lyla, Urte, Zach. This is a primary focus for most of the class.
    *   **Perform a surface dive (Skill 11):** 'Needs Practice' for Arriyan, Lucy. 'Fair' for Marshall, Urte. This is a key Stage 6 skill for these four.
    *   **25m optional stroke (Skill 9):** 'Needs Practice' for Arriyan, Lucy. 'Fair' for Marshall, Urte. 'Good' for Fletcher, George. This indicates a need for continuous swimming practice with good technique.
*   **Other specific areas for some:** Backstroke with rhythmical breaths (Arriyan, Lucy - NP; Urte - Fair). Front Crawl with rhythmical breaths (Arriyan, Lucy - NP). Swim 10 metres wearing clothes (David - Fair; Fletcher, Marshall, Urte - Not assessed).

Class: 16:00 Stage 6 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Improve Breaststroke technique, build stamina for 25m, and refine Surface Dive progression for all, with foundational stroke work for Arriyan and Lucy.
Swimmers: 12
Equipment: Kickboards, Woggles, Pullbuoys, Dive sticks/rings

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   **Teacher & Swimmers:** Welcome, name check.
*   **Pool Rules:** Recap poolside safety, deep-end rules, and listening to instructions. Emphasise clear commands and safety in a single lane. (Refer to `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p.7 "Safety").
*   **Warm-up Discussion (Skill 1):** Briefly discuss two examples of how to prepare for exercise and why it's important (e.g., stretching, dynamic movements, staying hydrated). Specifically check with Arriyan and Lucy for understanding.

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   **Dynamic Stretches (Dryside):** Arm circles, leg swings, torso twists.
*   **In-water warm-up:**
    *   **Group 1 (Arriyan, Lucy):** Gentle movement across the width in soldier position with woggles, focusing on feeling the water and small kicks. Teacher support as needed for confidence.
    *   **Group 2 (All others):** Continuous 25m swim (choice of stroke) focusing on consistent pace and good technique, rotating through the lane.
*   **Bubble Blowing / Submerging:** All swimmers practice blowing bubbles and gentle submersion, focusing on controlled exhalation.

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Station 1 (Advanced/Intermediate - Deep End): Surface Dive Progression (Skill 11) & 25m Swim (Skill 9)**
    *   Swimmers (Ava, Evie, Lyla, Toby, Zach, Fletcher, George, David, Marshall, Urte) practice the "Surface Dive Progression" (Technique 3) from `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p.4. Start with a simple feet-first entry, collect a sinking toy from the bottom (refer to `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p.3 "Submersibles").
    *   Progression: Perform a compact feet-first surface dive, then a tuck surface dive, then a head-first surface dive. Collect a sinker each time.
    *   After the dive, push and glide into a 25m swim (choice of stroke, focusing on efficient technique and pacing for David, Marshall, Urte who had 'Fair' on 25m).
    *   Teacher to give specific feedback on entry, depth, and streamline during the dive, and efficiency of the stroke.
*   **Station 2 (Beginners/Intermediate - Shallow End/Lane Side): Breaststroke Technique (Skill 7)**
    *   Swimmers (Arriyan, Lucy, and others needing Breaststroke refinement: Marshall, David, Fletcher, George, Lyla, Urte, Zach) work on Breaststroke technique.
    *   **Kick Drill:** Hold kickboard/woggle, practice "Lift, Flex, Circle, Push and Squeeze" (from `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p.36 "Breaststroke Kick"). Focus on strong push-off with the feet and holding the glide. Encourage "Unconventional Drills" such as "Froggy legs" or "Pizza slice" to visualise the kick.
    *   **Arm Drill:** Use pullbuoy or no equipment. Practice "11, Eat, 11" (from `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p.38 "Breaststroke Arms") on deck and then in water, focusing on the correct arm sequence and timing.
    *   **Coordination:** Combine kick and arm drills over short distances (e.g., 5-7m) with rhythmical breaths. Provide plenty of 1-on-1 feedback, especially for Arriyan and Lucy, reinforcing the coordination of the kick, pull, and breath.

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **Backstroke Legs (Technique 2 - for Arriyan, Lucy, Urte):** Using kickboards/woggles, practice "Backstroke Legs" with strong, continuous flutter kicks, keeping hips high and ears in the water. Focus on maintaining a flat body position on the back (refer to `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p.35 "Common Mistake: Poor Kick").
*   **Rescue Skills Practice (for Advanced/Intermediate - Skill 10 for Marshall):** Practice 'shout and signal' rescue scenarios from the poolside. Discuss what to do if someone else is in trouble. This can be done as a group discussion and demonstration while others are swimming. (Refer to `TEACHINGGUIDE.pdf` p.7 for water safety actions.)

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   **Gentle Kicking / Gliding:** Long, relaxed glides on front and back (as per `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p.33).
*   **Water Fun:** Collect sinkers from shallow water, simple water polo passing with a soft ball, or 'Seahorse races' with woggles (refer to `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p.41).
*   **Review & Praise:** Recap key learning points, praise effort, and encourage continued practice. Safe exit.

My Analysis
Note: No specific notes were provided for this class this week.
Note: Historical data indicated previous struggles with Push and Glide (P&G) on back for Burhan, George, and Reggie, and on both front/back for Sasha. The current report shows they have improved to 'Good' or 'Pass' for these skills, which is positive. However, Ava and Harvey still show 'Needs Practice' or 'Fair' for back P&G. Imogen remains at a very foundational level with many skills 'Not assessed' or 'Needs Practice' for back float recovery.
The current report highlights these key skill gaps:
*   **Beginners (Imogen):** Needs fundamental water confidence, safe entry, and basic movement. 'Needs Practice' on back float recovery to standing. Almost all other skills 'Not assessed'. This is the highest priority.
*   **Ava:** 'Fair' on front float recovery to standing. 'Needs Practice' on Push and Glide (P&G) front and back.
*   **Harvey:** 'Fair' on P&G back.
*   **Pool Rules (Skill 11):** 'Not assessed' for Esme and Harvey. 'Fair' for Burhan and Reggie. This requires a quick recap.
*   **Exit water safely (Skill 12):** 'Fair' for Sasha.

My Analysis
Note: No specific notes were provided for this class this week.
Note: Historical analysis is strongly aligned with the current report for this class. Cataleya is a complete beginner. Jacob, Bella, Peggy, and Una consistently show 'Needs Practice' or 'Fair' on float recoveries (back to standing, front to standing) and Push and Glides (front and back). Ellie needs focus on front P&G, and Frankie needs to improve float recoveries. Sara's back float recovery is 'Fair'.
The current report highlights these key skill gaps:
*   **Cataleya (Primary Focus):** 0% overall progress, all skills 'Not assessed'. Needs a very gentle, foundational introduction to water, safety, and basic movements.
*   **Jacob, Bella, Peggy, Una, Frankie, Sara (Core Focus):**
    *   **Float Recoveries (Skills 7 & 8):** 'Needs Practice' for Bella, Frankie, Peggy, Una. 'Fair' for Jacob, Sara. This is a significant widespread issue for regaining standing from floats.
    *   **Push and Glide Front (Skill 9):** 'Needs Practice' for Ellie. 'Not assessed' for Bella.
    *   **Push and Glide Back (Skill 10):** 'Needs Practice' for Jacob, Peggy.

My Analysis
Note: No specific notes were provided for this class this week.
Note: Historical analysis confirms the critical foundational issues for Arabella (almost all 'Not assessed' or 'Needs Practice'), Duaa, and Fabian (consistent 'Needs Practice' on floating shapes and head first sculling). Rupert also consistently struggles with head first sculling and log rolls. Myah and Shawn show persistent 'Needs Practice' or 'Fair' in push and glide to floor, head first sculling, and log rolls.
The current report highlights these key skill gaps:
*   **Beginners (Arabella, Duaa, Fabian):** All have significant 'Needs Practice' or 'Not assessed' in foundational skills like floating shapes (Skill 1) and head first sculling (Skill 7). Arabella is the most critical with very low progress and many 'Not assessed' skills, indicating a need for initial water confidence.
*   **Widespread Skill Gaps:**
    *   **Travel on the front and log roll in one continuous movement onto the back (Skill 9):** 'Needs Practice' for Chimamanda, Rupert, Shawn. 'Fair' for Myah. This is a key focus for most of the class.
    *   **Perform a head first sculling action for 5 metres in a flat position on the back (Skill 7):** 'Needs Practice' for Duaa, Fabian, Rupert. 'Fair' for Myah, Shawn. This is also a widespread issue.
    *   **Push and glide from the wall towards the pool floor (Skill 2):** 'Needs Practice' for Myah. 'Not assessed' for Arabella, Duaa, Fabian, Rupert. 'Fair' for Shawn. This also needs attention.
*   **Rupert:** Additionally 'Needs Practice' on log roll (front to back) and 'Fair' on floating shapes.

Focus: Improve endurance and challenging treading water for Silver Challenge swimmers. Refine Butterfly kick, Breaststroke, and Butterfly turns for Stage 8. Develop efficient starts and underwater kicking for Stage 9.
Swimmers: 12
Equipment: Kickboards, Pullbuoys, Dive Sticks/Rings, Stopwatch.

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   **Teacher & Swimmers:** Welcome, name check.
*   **Pool Rules:** Recap pool safety. Emphasise lane etiquette for mixed ability swimming and the importance of listening to commands for complex drills.
*   **Lesson Focus:** Briefly outline the main objectives for each group (endurance, turns, starts/underwater kicks).

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   **Continuous Swim (Mixed Pace):** All swimmers complete a continuous 100m swim (choice of stroke) as a warm-up. This allows the teacher to observe current form and endurance levels. Use a stopwatch for Alice and Elsie to monitor their 100m time (Skill A.2 for Silver Challenge).
*   **Dynamic Stretches & Streamline Practice:** Focus on arm circles and body rotations on deck, then in water, reinforcing the importance of streamline.

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Station 1 (Deep End/Starting Blocks - Stage 9 & Stage 8 Dive Focus): Starts, Underwater Kicking & Turns (Skills 5, 6, 8 Stage 9; Skill 11 Stage 8)**
    *   **Stage 9 Swimmers (Alvin, Ethan, Florence, Isaac):** Practice starts (Front Crawl for Ethan, Florence, Isaac; Backstroke & Breaststroke for Alvin) with focus on the 15m underwater kick in a streamlined position, then transition into full stroke. Use "Surface Dive Progression" (Technique 3) principles for powerful push-offs and streamlined entry (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p.4 "Dunking versus Scooping" and p.88 "Incremental Underwater Progression" for the concept of controlled progression).
    *   **Stage 8 Swimmers (Gen, Jessica, Oscar):** Focus on the dive track/grab start and butterfly kick underwater for 5-10 meters (Skill 11). Emphasise strong body undulation from the chest down (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p.42 "Butterfly Kick").
    *   **Turns:** Practice Breaststroke (Jack, Gen, Jessica, Oscar) and Butterfly turns (Jack, Jessica, Oscar) from 10m in to 15m out. Focus on precision and quick execution. Use "Unconventional Drills" for quick rotation (refer to `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p.48 "Open Turns").
*   **Station 2 (Shallow End/Lane Side - Silver Challenge & Stage 8 Kick/Turn Focus): Endurance, Treading Water & Butterfly Kick (Skills A.2, A.3 Silver; Skill 5 Stage 8)**
    *   **Silver Challenge Swimmers (Alice, Elsie):** Focus on sustained swimming for 100m using any stroke, aiming for under three minutes. Also dedicated practice for treading water for two minutes with one hand behind the back (Skill A.3). Provide encouragement and monitor technique.
    *   **Stage 8 Swimmers (Isla, Jack, Seb):** Concentrate on Butterfly kick (Skill 5) with kickboards/pullbuoys. Emphasise powerful undulation from the chest and consistent leg action.
    *   **Backstroke Kicking/Turns (Isla, Jack, Seb):** Practice "Backstroke Legs" (Technique 2) for 25m, maintaining high hips and a straight body line. Isla, Jack, Seb can also practice Backstroke turns (Skill 7 Stage 8).

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **Timed IM Challenges (Stage 9 & Advanced Stage 8):** For Alvin, Ethan, Florence, Isaac (Stage 9 Skill 3), and Jude (Stage 4, but strong), practice a 50m or 100m IM with recognised turns, using a stopwatch for pacing.
*   **Water Polo or Survival Sculling (Mixed Group - for Alice, Elsie):** Engage all swimmers in a fun but focused water polo passing drill to encourage purposeful swimming and treading water, or practice survival sculling for 30 seconds for Alice and Elsie to build confidence in water safety skills (refer to `TEACHINGGUIDE.pdf` p.10 "Using swimming skills and strokes for different purposes" and "survival and self-rescue skills").

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   **Gentle Kicking/Sculling:** Easy kickboard kicking or sculling across the width of the pool.
*   **Review & Praise:** Acknowledge the hard work on technical skills and endurance. Praise individual improvements. Safe exit.
