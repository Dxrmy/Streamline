## Student Progress Summary

### Dastan Miles (Stage 7)
*   **Skill Status:** `Push and glide and swim 100 meters, using a minimum of three different strokes` is **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** This may indicate an endurance or stroke technique issue when combining multiple strokes over a longer distance. He is performing well on shorter distances and individual strokes, suggesting the problem isn't fundamental technique but rather sustained application.
    *   **Priority:** Focus on drills that build stamina and reinforce smooth transitions between strokes for longer swims.

### Dusty Houghton (Stage 7)
*   **Skill Status:** Multiple skills are marked as **Needs Practice** or **Fair**: `Push and glide and swim 25 metres front crawl`, `Push and glide and swim 25 metres breaststroke`, `Push and glide and swim 25 metres butterfly`, `Push and glide and swim 100 meters, using a minimum of three different strokes`, and `Complete an obstacle course (using a minimum of 4 objects) with feet off the bottom throughout.`.
    *   **Hypothesis:** This suggests a general lack of confidence or consistency across a range of skills, particularly in stroke technique and sustained effort. The obstacle course also indicates potential issues with water confidence or coordination.
    *   **Priority:** This student requires significant attention. Prioritize building water confidence and breaking down the fundamental elements of each stroke. Focusing on one stroke at a time and ensuring mastery before moving on may be beneficial.

### Jonathan Baggs (Stage 7)
*   **Skill Status:** `Perform a movement sequence (linking skills with strokes & sculls)` is **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** While he is strong on individual skills and longer swims, linking them into a cohesive sequence is proving challenging. This could be due to difficulty with coordination, timing, or remembering the order of operations.
    *   **Priority:** Work on drills that encourage seamless transitions between different skills and strokes. Practice creating short, simple sequences before building to the full minute.

### Teo Bakrali (Stage 7)
*   **Skill Status:** `Perform a movement sequence (linking skills with strokes & sculls)` is **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Similar to Jonathan, Teo is struggling with combining various skills into a fluid sequence. This might stem from a lack of practice in integrating different movements or understanding how to transition smoothly.
    *   **Priority:** Focus on drills that require linking 2-3 skills together. Gradually increase the complexity and number of skills as he gains confidence.

**Group Trend:** For students performing the movement sequence, it appears to be a common challenge. This suggests that the transition from individual skill mastery to integrating them into a continuous, flowing sequence requires specific teaching focus.

## Student Progress Summary

### Albie Oldham (Stage 4)
*   **Skill Status:** `Kick 10 metres Backstroke` and `Kick 10 metres Butterfly` are **Needs Practice**. `Kick 10 metres Breaststroke` is **Fair**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Albie is struggling with consistent and effective leg kick for multiple strokes, particularly Backstroke and Butterfly. This could be due to poor technique, lack of leg strength, or difficulty coordinating the leg action with body position.
    *   **Priority:** Dedicate significant time to kick-specific drills for Backstroke and Butterfly. Use aids like kickboards to isolate the leg action and provide feedback.

### Flynn Mcmanus (Stage 4)
*   **Skill Status:** Significantly behind with multiple skills marked **Not assessed** or **Needs Practice** / **Fair**, including `Kick 10 metres Breaststroke`.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Flynn appears to be a foundational blocker. His limited engagement and consistent "Needs Practice" ratings across key skills suggest he may be struggling with basic water confidence or fundamental movement patterns.
    *   **Priority:** This is a critical area. The primary focus must be on building water confidence and mastering foundational skills like floating, gliding, and basic propulsion before attempting more complex strokes or distances.

### Harrison Waldron (Stage 4)
*   **Skill Status:** `Kick 10 metres Backstroke` and `Kick 10 metres Butterfly` are **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Similar to Albie, Harrison is experiencing difficulties with his Backstroke and Butterfly kicks. The consistency of this issue points to a potential problem with the mechanics of his leg action in these specific strokes.
    *   **Priority:** Focus on drills specifically designed to improve Backstroke and Butterfly kick technique. Emphasize correct foot and leg movements and body alignment.

### Kieran Waldron (Stage 4)
*   **Skill Status:** `Kick 10 metres Backstroke` and `Kick 10 metres Butterfly` are **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Kieran also exhibits a pattern of struggling with Backstroke and Butterfly kicking. This indicates a potential group trend in this class related to these specific leg actions.
    *   **Priority:** Reinforce Backstroke and Butterfly kick techniques. Consider pairing Kieran with students who demonstrate good kicking form to model the correct action.

### Olivia Gwin (Stage 4)
*   **Skill Status:** `Perform a sequence of changing shapes (minimum of 3) whilst floating flat at the surface & demonstrate and understanding of floating` and `Kick 10 metres Breaststroke` are **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Olivia's difficulty with changing shapes suggests a lack of body awareness and control in the water. This fundamental skill impacts her ability to maintain stability, which in turn likely affects her Breaststroke kick.
    *   **Priority:** Prioritize developing body control and shape-changing skills. Once she can demonstrate greater stability and awareness, revisit Breaststroke kick technique.

**Group Trend:** There is a notable trend of students struggling with Backstroke and Butterfly kicking in this class (Albie, Harrison, Kieran). Additionally, foundational skills like floating shapes are a concern for Olivia, and Flynn is significantly behind.

## Student Progress Summary

### Alfie Smith (Stage 2)
*   **Skill Status:** `Jump in from poolside safely` is **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Alfie may have apprehension or lack confidence when jumping into the water. This could be a fear-based issue or a lack of understanding of the correct technique.
    *   **Priority:** Focus on building confidence with entry. Start with smaller jumps from the poolside or steps, gradually increasing the height and distance as he becomes more comfortable.

### Ella Ebony (Stage 2)
*   **Skill Status:** `Travel using a recognised leg action, with feet on the pool floor on the back for 5 meters, without the use of floatation equipment` and `Perform a tuck to rotate from a flat floating position on the front, to a back floating position, then return to standing` are **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Ella struggles with traveling on her back using a leg action, which is fundamental for developing backstroke. The rotation skill is also a challenge, indicating potential issues with body control and transitioning between positions.
    *   **Priority:** Work on leg action drills for back floating and travel. Practice the tuck-and-rotate skills repeatedly, breaking them down into smaller steps if necessary.

### Elodie Blackshaw (Stage 2)
*   **Skill Status:** `Perform a tuck to rotate from a flat floating position on the front, to a back floating position, then return to standing` is **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** While Elodie is generally progressing well, this specific rotation skill is proving difficult. This suggests a potential issue with coordination or understanding the required body movement to achieve the rotation.
    *   **Priority:** Focus on breaking down the tuck-to-rotate movement. Provide clear, step-by-step instructions and demonstrations.

### Emma Ebony (Stage 2)
*   **Skill Status:** `Perform a tuck to rotate from a flat floating position on the front, to a back floating position, then return to standing` is **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Similar to Elodie, Emma is struggling with the front-to-back rotation. This points to a potential common challenge within the class regarding this specific body control skill.
    *   **Priority:** Reinforce the tuck-to-rotate skill. Use visual cues and physical guidance to help Emma understand the necessary movements.

### Olivia Trussler (Stage 2)
*   **Skill Status:** `Perform a tuck to rotate from a flat floating position on the front, to a back floating position, then return to standing` is **Needs Practice**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Olivia's difficulty with the front-to-back rotation is consistent with Elodie and Emma. This is a strong indicator that this skill needs focused attention for a portion of the class.
    *   **Priority:** Continue practicing the tuck-to-rotate skill, emphasizing the sequence of movements and providing consistent feedback.

**Group Trend:** The skill `Perform a tuck to rotate from a flat floating position on the front, to a back floating position, then return to standing` is a common area of difficulty for multiple students (Elodie, Emma, Olivia). This suggests a group-wide need for targeted practice on body rotation and control. Alfie's difficulty with jumping in also warrants individual attention to build confidence.
