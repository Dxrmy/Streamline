--- [Processing: 16:00 Stage 4] ---
My Analysis:
No specific weekly or ad-hoc notes were provided for this class.
Long-term analysis indicates all students in this class are generally progressing well and are on track for Stage 4, with no significant long-term trends of being stuck on particular skills.
Current report analysis reveals two students (Arthur Williams, Thea Abraham) have passed Stage 4 and are ready for new challenges. The remaining students show a primary skill gap in Butterfly kick (Albie Edgington-Turner, Elijah Hall, Felix Greenoff-Cairns, Ihechidere Mejeha, Leo Thornton - all 'Good'), and Sculling head first (Ihechidere Mejeha, Leo Thornton - both 'Fair'). Esmae Bateman has 'Good' in Push and glide from the wall towards the pool floor and Kick 10 metres Backstroke. Felix Greenoff-Cairns also has 'Good' in Push and glide from the wall towards the pool floor.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

Class: 16:00 Stage 4 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Refining Butterfly Kick and Sculling, introducing Stage 5 skills for advanced swimmers.
Swimmers: 8
Equipment: Woggles, Kickboards, Sinkers, Small floating toys

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   Welcome and quick register.
*   Brief safety talk: "Remember our poolside rules - walk, don't run. Listen for the whistle." (Referencing `SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, Stanley 4, page 11: "Answer 2 questions on poolside safety.")
*   Discuss the day's focus: "Today we'll be making our butterfly kicks super strong, practicing our sculling, and for some, trying out new Stage 5 challenges!"
*   Water entry: Safe entry from poolside.

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   **Dynamic Movement**: "Bean Game" (movement, spatial awareness, listening, shapes - from `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 41). Focus on different bean movements (running, jumping, broad, baked, chilli) across the width of the lane, encouraging active participation and listening.
*   **Targeted Kicking**: Holding onto the wall, perform 10m flutter kicks on front (chin in water, blowing bubbles) and back (ears in water, looking up). Encourage "floppy ankles" and "boiling the water" (Technique: "Unconventional Drills", referencing `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 18).
*   **Push and Glides**: Streamlined push and glides from the wall on front, holding for 3 seconds, then stand. Repeat on back.

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Group 1 (Advanced - Arthur, Thea)**:
    *   **Focus**: Introduction to Stage 5 Front Crawl arm action and Back Crawl arm action (from `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` Stanley 5, page 11).
    *   **Activity**: Work on deck first for arm circle motion ("Thumb, Hi, Pinky, Push" for backstroke, wide circles for front crawl - referencing `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` pages 22, 32). Then, in water, perform push and glides with attempts at arm action for 5-7m, using minimal woggle support if needed. Emphasize "Position 11" entry for front crawl arms (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 22).
*   **Group 2 (Developing - Albie, Elijah, Felix, Esmae, Ihechidere, Leo)**:
    *   **Focus**: Refining Butterfly Kick and Head First Sculling, improving Push & Glide to floor and Backstroke Kick.
    *   **Activity A (Butterfly Kick)**: Using kickboards or woggles (arms extended), practice 10m "Dolphin" kicks on front. Emphasize the "undulation" from chest to toes, keeping the head still ("Undulate = the wave" - referencing `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 42). Focus on legs moving together. Provide individual feedback.
    *   **Activity B (Sculling / Backstroke Kick / Push & Glide)**:
        *   **Sculling (Ihechidere, Leo)**: Head first sculling for 5m on back, using "Water Wheels" (sculling, paddle action, rotation from `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 42) or "Unconventional Drills" by trying to move small floating toys using only sculling hands.
        *   **Backstroke Kick (Esmae)**: Kick 10 metres Backstroke with woggle support behind shoulders, focusing on "Backstroke Legs" (Technique 2), keeping legs straight and toes pointed, aiming to "boil the water" with feet (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 18, 35).
        *   **Push & Glide to Floor (Esmae, Felix)**: Push and glide from the wall towards the pool floor, ensuring a strong, streamlined push and controlled descent. Use "weighted hoops" as targets on the pool floor (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 3, 4).
*   **Organisation**: Utilize "Top-and-Tailing". Advanced group works on one side of the lane, focusing on arms. Developing group works on the other side, rotating through butterfly kick and sculling/other targeted skills.

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **"Stanley's Toy Box"**: Swimmers collect sinking toys from the bottom of the pool (Stage 4, skill 4: Pick up an object from below the water surface - `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 11). This reinforces submerging and breath holding in a fun, engaging way. Encourage efficient movement.
*   **Floating Game**: "Breakfast Game" - calling out shapes (Fried eggs, bacon rashers, baked beans - from `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 43). Practice floating on front (Albie, Elijah, Felix, Ihechidere, Leo for Butterfly) and back (Esmae for Backstroke), holding different shapes (e.g., star float, narrow float).

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   **Gentle Kicking Race**: "Woggle Race" (kicking, splashing - from `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 42) across a short distance, focusing on relaxed flutter kicks.
*   **Review and Praise**: Gather students at the wall. "Great effort today, especially with those powerful butterfly kicks and smooth sculling!" Give positive feedback for effort, not just innate ability (referencing `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 64). Ask one or two students to demonstrate a skill they feel proud of.
*   **Safe Exit**: Review safe exit procedures and exit the water.

--- [Processing: 17:30 Stage 2] ---
My Analysis:
No specific weekly or ad-hoc notes were provided for this class.
Long-term analysis identifies a common "Needs Practice" area: `Perform a tuck to rotate from a flat floating position on the front, to a back floating position, then return to standing` (Ella Ebony, Elodie Blackshaw, Emma Ebony, Olivia Trussler). Alfie Smith has "Needs Practice" in `Jump in from poolside safely` and "Fair" in `Travel using a recognised leg action... on the back`. Ella Ebony also has "Needs Practice" in `Travel using a recognised leg action... on the back`. Marley Hampson Jones is the strongest (94%) and can be challenged.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

Class: 17:30 Stage 2 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Mastering front-to-back rotation, safe jumping, and backstroke leg action, with challenges for advanced swimmers.
Swimmers: 9
Equipment: Woggles, Kickboards, Floating hoops, Sinkers, Small floating toys

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   Welcome and quick register.
*   Safety reminder: "Remember to wait for your turn and listen for commands. We are safe and confident in the water!" (Referencing `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 54, "Using Command Language").
*   Discuss the day's focus: "Today we're going to become masters of spinning in the water and making our back kicks super strong!"
*   Water entry: Safe entry from poolside (Stage 2, skill 2 - `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 10). Alfie focuses on a controlled jump.

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   **"Jump and Splash"**: Jump up and down at poolside, submerge and blow bubbles (Stage 2, skill 3 - `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 17). For Alfie, focus on a safe, controlled entry, possibly starting with a sit-in entry and progressing to a small jump.
*   **Bubble Blowing**: Blow bubbles a minimum of 3 times rhythmically with nose and mouth submerged (Stage 2, skill 2 - `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 10). Encourage making "milkshakes" with bubbles.
*   **Moving through water**: Walk forwards, backwards, and sideways in the shallow end, encouraging water resistance.

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Group 1 (Rotation Focus - Ella, Elodie, Emma Ebony, Olivia)**:
    *   **Focus**: `Perform a tuck to rotate from a flat floating position on the front, to a back floating position, then return to standing` (Stage 2, skill 9).
    *   **Activity A (Tuck & Rotate Progression)**:
        1.  Start from a front float (arms extended, face in water).
        2.  "Tuck like a ball": bring knees to chest, chin to chest.
        3.  "Roll to the sky": gently push water with hands to assist rotation from front to back. Emphasize looking up at the ceiling as they roll (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` Stanley 2, page 19).
        4.  "Stretch like a star": stretch arms and legs wide to flat back float.
        5.  Return to standing.
    *   **Teaching Tip**: Use "Unconventional Drills" - "Pretzel Woggle" (Technique 1): Place a woggle around waist/back to provide a pivot point for easier rotation. Physically guide them through the rotation if needed, keeping verbal cues concise (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 55 "Action words").
*   **Group 2 (Leg Action/Jump Focus - Alfie, Ella, Emma Mariel Albert, Lottie)**:
    *   **Focus**: `Travel using a recognised leg action... on the back` (Stage 2, skill 7) and safe poolside jumps.
    *   **Activity A (Backstroke Legs)**: With woggle support behind shoulders, kick 5m on back, using "Backstroke Legs" (Technique 2), focusing on an alternating leg action, keeping toes pointed and eyes looking at the ceiling (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` Stanley 2, page 10, skill 5). "Try to make little splashes with your toes."
    *   **Activity B (Safe Jumps for Alfie)**: Focus on Alfie's "Needs Practice" for safe entry. Start with a sitting jump from the poolside (knees bent, feet over edge), then progress to a standing jump, with instructor support if needed. Emphasize "Toes over edge, look out, step out, bend knees on entry" (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` Stanley 2, page 20, teaching points for jumping in). Provide positive reinforcement for effort (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 65).
*   **Group 3 (Advanced - Marley, Arlo, Ezra)**:
    *   **Focus**: Introduction to Stage 3 skills (alternating arm action, treading water) and refining existing Stage 2 skills.
    *   **Activity A (Alternating Arm Action)**: Practice front paddle arm action for 5m. Introduce alternating arm action for front crawl on kickboards, keeping head down and blowing bubbles. "Reach and pull, one arm at a time."
    *   **Activity B (Treading Water Legs)**: Introduce basic treading water leg action, possibly holding onto the wall or a woggle for support (similar to Stage 3, skill 10 "Tread water action with legs on woggle" - `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 11).
*   **Organisation**: Rotation group works from the middle of the lane. Leg action/jump group works at the wall. Advanced group works at the other end of the lane, possibly with fins for more propulsion. Use "Top-and-Tailing" with distinct activities for each group.

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **"Stanley's Treasure"**: Split into two teams. Teacher calls two names (one from each team) to race to the middle to collect a floating toy and return it to their side (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 41). This promotes propulsion and quick movement.
*   **Push & Glide through Hoop**: Push and glide on front through a hoop held at the surface. Encourage a good streamline (Stage 2, `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 17).

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   **"Seahorse Ride"**: Swimmers sit on woggles and move gently across the pool, using their arms and legs to relax.
*   **Review and Praise**: Ask students what was challenging and what was fun. Offer specific, positive feedback. "Marley, excellent work with those new arm movements!" "Ella, I saw great tucks today!"
*   **Safe Exit**: Remind everyone to exit the water safely, without pushing or running.
