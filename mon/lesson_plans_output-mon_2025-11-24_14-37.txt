My Analysis:
Note: Oliver Rathbone has not been assessed on any skills for the last three weeks, indicating a significant barrier to participation or progression. He requires immediate, foundational support and assessment during the lesson.
Note: Albie, Harrison, and Kieran consistently show "Needs Practice" for various kicks and changing shapes. Olivia struggles with changing shapes and breaststroke kick. Mayra needs work on sculling. Arthur, Felix, Natan, and Thea are nearing completion of Stage 4 and need refinement in their 10m swim and other specific skills. Jonathan and Teo need to develop their 1-minute movement sequence.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

Class: 16:00 Stage 4 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Foundational re-engagement for Oliver, refine push and glide to pool floor, butterfly kick, and sculling for main group.
Swimmers: 10
Equipment: Woggles, kickboards, sinking toys/rings, small balls.

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   Welcome and register.
*   Brief on pool rules and safe entry (e.g., sitting entry, walking in). Emphasize listening to instructions and staying within designated areas.
*   Quick check-in with Oliver individually to understand his comfort level and any specific concerns, reinforcing trust and support as per `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` (page 58, 86).

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   **Group Activity:** "Seahorses" using woggles (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 42). Swimmers sit on woggles and use arms/legs to move across the pool. Teacher can specify actions like "move forward," "turn around." This allows observation of body position and kick.
    *   **Differentiation:**
        *   **Oliver:** Teacher provides close 1:1 support, guiding him gently on a woggle to build confidence in movement and water feel, focusing on basic splashes and blowing bubbles.
        *   **Albie, Esmae, Felix, Elijah, Ihechidere, Leo:** Focus on strong, continuous kicking action while on the woggle.
        *   **Arthur, Natan, Thea:** Encourage streamlined movement with minimal splash, focusing on consistent propulsion.

Main Activity (10-12 mins): Focus on "Needs Practice"
*   **Activity 1: Push and Glide to Pool Floor Progression (Top-and-Tailing)**
    *   **Drill:** Swimmers push and glide from wall, aiming to glide towards the pool floor (Stage 4, Skill 2). Use sinking rings as targets on the floor to encourage a downward glide.
        *   **Group 1 (Albie, Esmae, Felix):** Focus on a strong push, maintaining a streamlined body position and actively pushing towards the target without lifting their head.
        *   **Group 2 (Arthur, Elijah, Ihechidere, Leo, Natan, Thea):** Refine their push-off, emphasizing minimal resistance and efficient underwater glide. Encourage a small dolphin kick as they approach the rings for efficiency.
    *   **Technique 4 (Unconventional Drills):** "Submarine Dive" - Imagine they are a submarine pushing off and diving to locate "treasure" (sinking rings) on the pool floor.
*   **Activity 2: Butterfly Kick & Sculling Rotation (Top-and-Tailing)**
    *   **Drill 1 (Butterfly Kick):** Kick 10 metres Butterfly on front or back using a kickboard for support, focusing on undulation from the hips down (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 42-43).
        *   **Albie, Felix, Elijah, Ihechidere, Leo:** Emphasize a smooth, flowing undulation starting from the chest and hips, with feet together. Use kickboards.
        *   **Arthur, Natan, Thea, Esmae:** Focus on powerful, rhythmic butterfly kicks, trying to "boil the water" with their feet (SWIMTEACHV3.pdf page 18).
    *   **Drill 2 (Sculling):** Perform head-first sculling on the back for 5 metres (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` Stage 4, Skill 7). Use small balls to scull across the pool (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 11, Stanley 4, LO 7 mentions treading water with arms and legs, can apply to sculling).
        *   **Ihechidere, Leo, Mayra:** Focused practice on sculling motion with head-first direction, keeping feet relaxed.
        *   **Natan:** Refine sculling for efficiency and control, perhaps introducing feet-first sculling if comfortable.
    *   **Oliver:** Work 1:1 with the teacher on basic push and glides, or assisted kicking with a woggle/kickboard. The teacher should frequently ask "Do you want to put your chin in?" (from `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 86, 88).

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **Activity: "Stanley's Toy Box" with a twist for Push & Glide and Sculling** (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 41).
    *   Scatter sinking toys (to encourage push and glide to floor) and floating balls (for sculling practice) across the lane.
    *   Swimmers push and glide towards a sinking toy, retrieve it, then scull back to a designated floating hoop (or the side) with a floating ball.
    *   **Differentiation:**
        *   **Albie, Esmae, Felix:** Focus on smooth transition from push & glide to retrieving the toy, then sculling the floating ball back.
        *   **Ihechidere, Leo, Mayra:** Concentrate on effective sculling technique while returning with the ball.
        *   **Oliver:** Work with the teacher on retrieving easy-to-reach floating toys, practicing gentle water entry and basic arm movements.

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   **Activity:** "Floating Game" (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf` page 28). Swimmers relax into a star float on their back, then change to a narrow float.
*   Review key learning points about strong pushes, relaxed kicks, and sculling.
*   Praise effort and participation, especially for Oliver's engagement (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` page 64-65).
*   Safe exit from the pool.
