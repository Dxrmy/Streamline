Class: 16:00 Stage 4 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing breaststroke kick and improving front crawl body position.
Swimmers: 9
Equipment: Kickboards, woggles

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   Welcome swimmers and recap poolside safety.
*   Briefly introduce today's focus: developing a strong breaststroke kick and improving front crawl body position for better streamlining.
*   Emphasise listening to instructions and staying in their designated area.

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   Sit on poolside, splash water.
*   Safe entry.
*   Kick on wall with knees together, feet flexed, and practice pushing off in a streamlined position.
*   "Monkey across pool" holding onto the wall or with a woggle for support.

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Breaststroke Kick Progression:** (Referencing `TEACHINGGUIDE.pdf` and `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` for breaststroke kick technique)
    *   On the wall: "Sit on the side" with legs in the water, focus on "flex" (feet neutral, lift feet above knees, flex feet, knees close together).
    *   In water: Supported glides with focus on the "flex" and "push, squeeze" action, emphasizing keeping knees close and pushing water with the inside of the feet. Use woggles if needed for support. (2-3 mins)
    *   "Kick on the side" with support, focusing on a controlled leg action and keeping hips and legs together. (2-3 mins)
    *   Supported front glides with a focus on the breaststroke kick. Encourage swimmers to make splashes with their feet. (3-4 mins)
*   **Front Crawl Body Position:** (Referencing `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` for front crawl body position)
    *   Using woggles for support, practice swimming short distances focusing on a long body line and keeping the head still, looking down, with arms moving in a straight line. (2-3 mins)

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **"Arm stroke challenge" with woggles:** Swimmers use woggles for support and practice front crawl arm action, focusing on the "push" and "recovery" motion, without worrying too much about breathing initially. They can do this in pairs or individually, focusing on smooth arm movements.

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   A short "fun swim" with the woggles, perhaps a gentle race or a game of "catch" using floating toys, reinforcing the skills practiced.
*   Final reminder of safe exit from the pool.

Class: 16:30 Stage 7 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Improving endurance for the 100m swim and developing smooth transitions in a movement sequence.
Swimmers: 9
Equipment: Woggles, possibly kickboards

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   Welcome swimmers and briefly outline the session's focus: building endurance for longer swims and working on linking skills smoothly.
*   Reiterate poolside safety and behaviour expectations.

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   Sit on poolside, splash water.
*   Safe entry.
*   Swim 50m continuously using a preferred stroke, focusing on maintaining consistent technique.
*   Tread water for 30 seconds, then perform 5 "star jumps" to come to a standing position.

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Endurance Building:** (Referencing `SEQ L2 TEACHING.pdf` for Stage 7 outcomes)
    *   **100m Swim:** Swimmers attempt to swim 100m continuously using their strongest stroke. Focus on maintaining good technique and breathing throughout the distance. Coach provides encouragement and verbal cues from the poolside. (5-6 mins)
    *   **"Stroke Play":** Swimmers choose a stroke and swim 25m, then immediately transition to another stroke for another 25m. Focus on smooth transitions between strokes. (5-6 mins)

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **Movement Sequence Practice:** (Referencing `SEQ L2 TEACHING.pdf` for movement sequence)
    *   In small groups (2-3), swimmers link skills together: a push and glide on the back, followed by a scull, then a log roll, and finishing with a short swim. Focus on making the transitions smooth and continuous, linking at least 3-4 skills together. Use woggles for support if needed for the sculling or log roll.

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   A short, fun activity that encourages teamwork and reinforces skills. Perhaps a gentle relay race involving different strokes or a short "obstacle course" in the water that requires simple turns or glides.
*   Quick recap of the session's key points and safe exit.

Class: 17:00 Stage 4 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Reinforcing Backstroke and Butterfly kick technique and improving basic floating.
Swimmers: 8
Equipment: Kickboards, woggles

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   Welcome swimmers.
*   Briefly recap poolside safety.
*   Introduce today's focus: improving the Backstroke and Butterfly kick, and strengthening basic floating skills.

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   Sit on poolside, splash water.
*   Safe entry.
*   Kick on wall with good body shape (straight body, flexed feet).
*   "Monkey across pool" with a woggle for support.

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Backstroke Kick Focus:** (Referencing `TEACHINGGUIDE.pdf` for backstroke kick)
    *   Kick with kickboards, focusing on relaxed ankles ("floppy"), keeping knees slightly bent, and a continuous kick. Encourage swimmers to look up at the ceiling. (3-4 mins)
    *   Supported back glides with a focus on maintaining a straight body line and a consistent backstroke kick. Use "hands on shoulders" or "head on shoulder" holds for support. (3-4 mins)
*   **Butterfly Kick Introduction/Refinement:** (Referencing `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` for butterfly kick)
    *   On the deck: Practice the "undulation" movement, thinking of a "wave" motion from chest to feet. (1-2 mins)
    *   In the water: Supported front glides with a focus on the butterfly kick (hips drive the motion, chest presses down, feet snap together). Use woggles for support. (2-3 mins)
*   **Floating Practice:** (Referencing `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` for floating)
    *   Practice "star float" and "tuck float" positions, both front and back, with as much support as needed. Focus on finding a balanced position. (2-3 mins)

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **"Toy Retrieval" with a twist:** Using sinking toys, swimmers must retrieve them while maintaining a good front glide position, focusing on looking down. If they struggle with going underwater, they can try to touch the toy with their hand first.

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   A simple game like "Simon Says" that incorporates the skills practiced, e.g., "Simon says kick like a butterfly!" or "Simon says float on your back!".
*   Safe exit.

Class: 17:30 Stage 2 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing safe entries, front-to-back rotation, and front leg action.
Swimmers: 8
Equipment: Woggles

Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):
*   Welcome swimmers.
*   Briefly recap poolside safety.
*   Introduce today's focus: safe entries, rotating from front to back, and improving the front leg action.

Warm-up (5-7 mins):
*   Sit on poolside, splash water.
*   Safe entry: demonstrate and practice stepping down the steps, bending knees, and jumping high with a breath.
*   "Jump up and down at poolside," submerging mouth and nose to blow bubbles rhythmically.
*   "Monkey across pool" with woggles.

Main Activity (10-12 mins):
*   **Safe Entries:** (Referencing `SEQ L1 SWIMMING ASSISTANT.pdf` for safe entries)
    *   Practice jumping in from the poolside, focusing on a safe entry with controlled landing and immediate return to the wall. (2-3 mins)
*   **Front to Back Rotation:** (Referencing `STANLEY RESOURCE MANUAL.pdf` for Stage 2 skills)
    *   Supported rotation from a front float to a back float and return to standing. Use woggles for support. Focus on tucking knees to the chest and controlling the movement. (4-5 mins)
*   **Front Leg Action:** (Referencing `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` for flutter kick)
    *   Supported flutter kick practice on the front. Use woggles for support, focusing on a relaxed ankle and a consistent kick. Encourage swimmers to make splashes with their feet. (4-5 mins)

Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):
*   **"Seahorse Race":** Swimmers use woggles to move across the pool, focusing on their leg action and maintaining a good body position. This reinforces the leg kick work from the main activity.

Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):
*   A fun game involving woggles, like a "woggle train" or a simple "red light, green light" using the leg actions practiced.
*   Safe exit from the pool.
