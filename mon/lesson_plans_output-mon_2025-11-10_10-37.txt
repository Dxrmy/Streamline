# 16:00 Stage 4

### My Analysis
*   **Priority 1:** No weekly or ad-hoc teacher notes provided.
*   **Priority 2:** Long-term analysis indicates potential issues with push and glide for Ihechidere Mejeha, butterfly kick for Leo Thornton, and breaststroke kick for Olivia Gwin. Albie Oldham, Harrison Waldron, and Kieran Waldron have low overall progress and need skills assessed. Hridhika Harish also has a "Needs Practice" on swimming 10 metres.
*   **Priority 3:** The main skill gaps identified from the current report for this class are:
    *   Ihechidere Mejeha: Push and glide from the wall (Fair).
    *   Leo Thornton: Kick 10 metres Butterfly (Fair).
    *   Olivia Gwin: Kick 10 metres Breaststroke (Needs Practice).
    *   Albie Oldham, Harrison Waldron, Kieran Waldron: Overall progress low, require assessment of multiple skills, particularly kicking.
    *   Hridhika Harish: Push and glide and swim 10 metres (Needs Practice).
*   **Planning Method:** Top-and-Tailing

**Class:** 16:00 Stage 4 | **Method:** Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
**Focus:** Developing core Stage 4 skills, focusing on kick and glide.
**Swimmers:** 9
**Equipment:** Kickboards (6), Woggles (2)

**Introduction & Safety (3-5 mins):**
*   Welcome swimmers and parents.
*   Briefly outline the lesson's focus: kicking and gliding.
*   Safety: Remind swimmers about poolside rules and safe entry into the water. Emphasize staying within the designated area.
*   Check for any concerns or needs before starting.

**Warm-up (5-7 mins):**
*   **Activity:** Sit on poolside, splash water, safe entries (jump in, walk in).
*   **Focus:** Water confidence, listening skills.
*   **Teaching Points (from `TEACHINGGUIDE.pdf` and `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`):**
    *   Encourage big and little kicks while sitting on the poolside.
    *   Safe entries: Demonstrate backwards down steps, walk in, swivel entry.
    *   Encourage jumping up and down, blow bubbles.

**Main Activity (10-12 mins):**
*   **Focus:** Kicking technique and controlled gliding. Address specific needs identified.
*   **Activity 1 (Addressing Kicking Needs):**
    *   **Front Crawl Kick:** Using kickboards, swimmers practice front crawl kick for 10 metres.
        *   **For Hridhika Harish, Albie Oldham, Harrison Waldron, Kieran Waldron:** Focus on keeping legs straight, using flutter kick, pointing toes. Provide support on thighs if needed.
        *   **For Leo Thornton:** Continue front crawl kick, encouraging a good tempo.
    *   **Breaststroke Kick:** Using kickboards, swimmers practice breaststroke kick for 10 metres.
        *   **For Olivia Gwin:** Focus on the "flex" and "squeeze" of the breaststroke kick, ensuring feet are turned outwards and the kick is a push and squeeze. Use the "Sit on the side" drill as a progression.
*   **Activity 2 (Addressing Glide Needs):**
    *   **Push and Glide:** Swimmers practice push and glide from the wall.
        *   **For Ihechidere Mejeha:** Focus on a strong push off the wall and maintaining a streamlined body position with arms extended, head down, and legs together.
        *   **For Albie Oldham, Harrison Waldron, Kieran Waldron:** Start with a shorter glide from the wall, focusing on pushing off and reaching forward.
    *   **Assisted Glides:** For those struggling, provide supported glides.

**Contrast Activity (5-7 mins):**
*   **Activity:** "Seahorse Race" or "Woggle Waterfalls"
*   **Focus:** Applying kicking skills in a fun, engaging way.
*   **Teaching Points:**
    *   **Seahorse Race (using woggles):** Swimmers sit on woggles, using arms and legs to move across the pool. Focus on maintaining a streamlined position while moving.
    *   **Woggle Waterfalls (using woggles):** Swimmers hold a woggle, practicing kicking to move through a 'waterfall' (instructor can create this by splashing or holding a woggle). Focus on maintaining body position while kicking.

**Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):**
*   **Activity:** "Red light, Green light" using kicking.
*   **Focus:** Relaxing, reinforcing kick control.
*   **Teaching Points:**
    *   Swimmers kick across a short distance. When the instructor shouts "Red light," they stop kicking and hold their streamline. When "Green light" is called, they resume kicking.
    *   Congratulate all swimmers on their effort and progress.
    *   Safe exit from the pool.

*   **Teaching Points:**
    *   Divide swimmers into two teams.
    *   Team members complete a length of front crawl, followed by a short, pre-planned movement sequence (e.g., 2 log rolls, tread water for 10 seconds), then a length of backstroke.
    *   Emphasize teamwork and encouraging each other.

**Cooldown & Fun (3-5 mins):**
*   **Activity:** "Fun with 100m IM" - a modified, shorter IM to build stamina and introduce the concept.
*   **Focus:** Gradually building stamina and confidence in different strokes.
*   **Teaching Points:**
    *   Swimmers complete a shorter distance of each stroke (e.g., 10m backstroke, 10m breaststroke, 10m front crawl, 5m butterfly) focusing on continuous movement.
    *   **For Teddy Stenson:** Focus on completing each segment with a clear effort, rather than perfect technique initially.
    *   Congratulate all swimmers on their effort and willingness to tackle challenging skills.
    *   Safe exit from the pool.
