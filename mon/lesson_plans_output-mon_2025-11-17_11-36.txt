--- [Processing: 16:00 Stage 4] ---
My Analysis:
Note: All Stage 4 swimmers show a tendency to hold onto the wall, which impedes lesson flow, especially with limited lane space (3/4 for Stage 4, 1/4 for Stage 3). Felix (autistic) is resistant to instruction ("you don't understand," "it's harder than it looks") and may thrash. Arthur has listening issues. Thea is nervous and climbs out to speak to her mother. For Felix, clear, concise commands and offering choices are crucial (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 92 - Adaption). For Arthur, focus on clear command language and positive reinforcement (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 54). For Thea, acknowledge her nervousness and reassure her, providing support and engaging activities (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 92). The long-term analysis identifies a group trend of struggling with sculling action. The current report shows 5 out of 9 students with "Not assessed" or "Good" in sculling (Skill 7), making it a primary skill gap. Elijah has "Fair" in Travel on front and log roll (Skill 9). Many have "Good" in Push and glide (Skill 2) and Butterfly kick (Skill 5). Albie, Arthur, and Esmae are progressing well, while Ihechidere, Leo, Natan, and Thea also need to focus on sculling.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

Class: 16:00 Stage 4 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Introducing and practicing head-first sculling on the back, reinforcing log rolls, and developing flutter kick for propulsion, while managing group dynamics and engagement.
Swimmers: 9
Equipment: 9 Woggles, 5 kickboards, sinking rings, small floating toys

Introduction & Safety (4 mins):
*   **Welcome & Rules:** Greet swimmers, review pool rules (no running, listening to teacher). Emphasize "listening ears" for Arthur and praise when he demonstrates good listening. Address Thea's nervousness by stating a clear, calm expectation for staying in the water, "We'll all stay in the water together today."
*   **Entries:** Safe entry from poolside (feet first).
*   **Water Agility:** "Sea Horses" game using woggles (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, page 42) – swimmers sit on woggles, use hands and feet to paddle around. This encourages movement away from the wall. For Felix, offer a choice: "Do you want to be a Sea Horse, or a speed boat?" - allowing him some control and choice (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 92).

Warm-up (6 mins):
*   **Bubbles & Submerging:** Hold onto the wall, blow rhythmic bubbles, "count to 3 fish bubbles" (nose and mouth submerged). Gradually progress to blowing bubbles and retrieving sinking rings from the floor. Use incremental underwater progression: chin, lips, nose (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 4, 88). For Thea, offer "Do you want to put your chin in?" and acknowledge her choice (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 86).
*   **Flutter Kicks (Wall Support):** Holding onto the wall, practice flutter kicks. Emphasize "floppy ankles" and kicking from the hip (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 18).
*   **"Motorbike Woggle" Kick:** Using the "Motorbike/Pretzel Woggle" technique (woggle under arms/chest), kick 5m Front Crawl. Focus on keeping the body streamlined and hips high. This encourages moving away from the wall.

Main Activity (12 mins):
*   **Head-First Sculling on Back (Stage 4, Skill 7):**
    *   **Demonstration & Core Practice:** Demonstrate head-first sculling on the back in a flat position. Explain it's like "painting the ceiling" with their hands.
    *   **Progression 1 (Assisted):** Swimmers partner up (top-and-tailing, or one watches, one performs). Use a woggle for support under hips/back. Focus on the sculling action for 5m. Teacher provides hands-on support as needed. Remind them to look at the ceiling. Ihechidere, Leo, Natan, Thea specifically focus here.
    *   **Progression 2 (Independent):** Reduce or remove woggle support. Encourage swimmers to maintain a flat body position while sculling 5m. Reinforce "long body, near surface" (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 32).
    *   **"Unconventional Drills" (Sculling Race):** A "Scorpion Race" (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, page 42) – lying on a woggle (under chest/hips), use sculling arms (and legs if needed) to race across 5m. This engages competitive spirit while practicing the skill.
*   **Travel on Front & Log Roll (Stage 4, Skill 9):**
    *   **Drill:** Push and glide on front, kick 5m Front Crawl, then log roll onto back and float. Elijah, who is "Fair" in this skill, receives targeted feedback: "Elijah, great kick, next time remember to keep your body straight as you roll." (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 68).
    *   **Top-and-Tailing:** Swimmers execute the drill one at a time, moving down the lane.

Contrast Activity (5 mins):
*   **Push & Glide with Underwater Object Retrieval:** Push and glide from the wall towards the pool floor, retrieve a sinking ring (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, page 3). This works on breath control and underwater confidence (Stage 4, Skill 4, 2). For those hesitant to submerge (Thea), offer a choice: "Would you like to try for the yellow ring with your chin in, or push and glide and swim over it?" (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 92 - choice).
*   **"Motorbike/Pretzel Woggle" Challenge:** Swimmers kick 10m holding a woggle like a "Motorbike" (under armpits) across the lane, focusing on continuous flutter kick. Challenge them to maintain speed and body position.

Cooldown & Fun (3 mins):
*   **Floating Game:** "Starfish Float" on back. Encourage relaxation and gentle breathing.
*   **Review & Praise:** Gather swimmers at the wall. Praise everyone for their effort and highlight specific achievements, e.g., "Great sculling today, everyone!" and "Albie, excellent push and glide!" Ensure individual feedback is given. Remind them about the next week's focus. For Felix, praise his effort regardless of specific achievement (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 64). Address Maisie's talking by actively listening to her during the brief chat, then moving straight to the next instruction: "Maisie, that sounds fun! Now, let's try our starfish float. Ready? Go."

--- [Processing: 16:30 Stage 7] ---
My Analysis:
Note: The teacher stated "this stage goes swell", implying no immediate concerns beyond the long-term trends and current report. Dusty is a complete beginner (0% assessed), Jessica (50%) and Teddy (43%) are also struggling with multiple skills and need significant attention. Jonathan and Teo "Needs Practice" in movement sequence (Skill 5). Samuel and Jonathan are "Fair" in treading water (Skill 9). Dastan "Needs Practice" in Swim 100m (Skill 8). Jessica and Teddy need work on multiple strokes. Moustafa and Neel have passed all skills (100%), requiring advanced challenges. The primary skill gaps for the majority are movement sequences (linking skills with strokes and sculls) and treading water, as highlighted in the long-term analysis. Dusty will be integrated with simplified tasks where possible.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

Class: 16:30 Stage 7 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing movement sequences combining strokes and sculls, refining treading water with eggbeater action, and providing targeted stroke correction for struggling swimmers.
Swimmers: 10
Equipment: 2 Kickboards, 2 Pull buoys, 4 Woggles, Sinking rings, 2 Hoops

Introduction & Safety (4 mins):
*   **Welcome & Safety:** Greet swimmers, review lane etiquette for top-and-tailing (e.g., waiting at opposite ends). Quick discussion on water safety (e.g., "What should you do if you get a cramp?" - `SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, page 37, Stanley 7 Lesson Plan 1, Learning Outcome 1).
*   **Entries:** Safe diving entry (sitting dive or standing dive - Stage 7, Skill 6). For Teddy and Jessica who are "Fair" in dive, offer a sitting dive with a focus on streamlining. For Moustafa and Neel, challenge with a dive from standing. For Dusty, a safe entry from poolside with support.

Warm-up (6 mins):
*   **Continuous Swim Warm-up (Top-and-Tailing):** Swim 25m choice of stroke (Front Crawl, Backstroke, Breaststroke). Focus on steady pace and maintaining technique. Moustafa and Neel can do 50m. Dusty, Jessica, Teddy: focus on 10-15m with chosen stroke using kickboard/woggle for support.
*   **Sculling Practice:** Perform head-first sculling (Stage 7, Skill 5 component). Start in a flat position on the back, then on the front. Progress to feet-first sculling if confident.

Main Activity (12 mins):
*   **Movement Sequence Development (Stage 7, Skill 5): Linking Skills, Strokes, & Sculls**
    *   **Concept Introduction:** Explain linking skills (sculling, rotation, floating, eggbeater) with strokes. Refer to `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` (Stage 7 Teaching Objectives, "Movement sequence (linking skills with strokes & sculls)").
    *   **Progression 1 (Scull & Rotate):** Push and glide on back, scull head-first for 5m, then log roll onto front and kick 5m Front Crawl. Focus on continuous movement. Jonathan and Teo get specific coaching on smooth transitions.
    *   **Progression 2 (Float & Scull):** Perform a star float on back, tuck to a narrow float, then use sculling to propel 5m feet-first, then roll onto front and swim 5m Breaststroke. For Moustafa and Neel, challenge with complex rotations (e.g., somersault).
    *   **"Unconventional Drills" (Sequence Relay):** Split into two teams (top-and-tailing). Each team member performs a segment of a sequence (e.g., dive, 10m Front Crawl, 5m scull back, log roll, 10m Backstroke). This enhances group interaction and provides practice under playful pressure.
*   **Treading Water (Stage 7, Skill 9) with Eggbeater Action:**
    *   **Drill:** Practice eggbeater kick for 30 seconds. Focus on continuous leg action and maintaining head above water. Samuel and Jonathan, who were "Fair" in this, get targeted feedback on leg action and body position.
    *   **Progression:** Add lifting one or both arms out of the water for 5 seconds while treading water, then switch. Dusty will focus on basic doggy paddle treading in a shallower area if available.

Contrast Activity (5 mins):
*   **Stroke Refinement & Endurance:**
    *   **"Unconventional Drills" (Stroke Focus):** Swimmers perform 25m of a stroke they need to improve (Jessica: Backstroke/Butterfly; Teddy: Breaststroke/Butterfly). Use pull buoys for arm focus or kickboards for leg focus.
    *   **Backstroke Legs (Technique 2):** For those working on backstroke (Jessica, Teddy), focus on "Backstroke Legs" - keeping kick strong and narrow, originating from hips with floppy ankles (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 18, 35).
    *   **Surface Dive Progression (Technique 3):** For Moustafa & Neel, introduce "Surface Dive Progression" (Stage 6+ in `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` context, although not explicitly named this in the document, refers to head-first submerging/retrieval). Push and glide to pool floor, retrieve object, swim back underwater. This aligns with Stage 7, Skill 9, which can incorporate submersibles. For Teo, include obstacle course elements (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, Stanley 7, Skill 10) by swimming through hoops and retrieving sinkers.

Cooldown & Fun (3 mins):
*   **Stretching & Relaxation:** Gentle stretches in the water.
*   **Free Play with Floating Toys:** Allow brief free play with floating toys to relax and enjoy the water.
*   **Review & Praise:** Praise all swimmers for their effort and specific improvements in movement sequences and treading water. Acknowledge the effort of Jessica, Teddy, and Dusty particularly. Encourage Dastan on his 100m continuous swim goal.

--- [Processing: 17:00 Stage 4] ---
My Analysis:
Note: Albie O doesn't listen, and Maisie talks too much. I need to keep the kids entertained during instruction, perhaps by asking about their day or favorite ice cream before swimming (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 78). Arlo F-B "can barely swim" (needs foundational help). Flynn and Albie O are extremely low progress (0% and 13% assessed, respectively) with multiple "Needs Practice" across all kicks and push and glide. Harrison and Kieran also have many "Needs Practice" for kicks and floating. Ezra, Olivia G, and Arlo F-B also need "Floating shapes" practice. Mayra needs "Sculling" practice. The primary skill gaps are floating (Skill 1), various kicks (Skills 3,4,5,6), and push and glide (Skills 2,10). Maisie (100%) and Jacob (93%) are high achievers.
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

Class: 17:00 Stage 4 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing fundamental kicking techniques (Front Crawl, Backstroke, Breaststroke), floating skills, and strong push and glides, while implementing strategies for engagement and managing low ability swimmers.
Swimmers: 10
Equipment: 10 Woggles, 5 Kickboards, small floating toys, sinking rings

Introduction & Safety (4 mins):
*   **Welcome & Engagement:** Greet swimmers. Engage Albie O and Maisie quickly by asking a fun question (e.g., "What's your favorite ice cream today?"). Immediately follow with a clear safety command (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 78, 54).
*   **Rules & Entries:** Review poolside safety and safe entry (e.g., sitting entry or step-in). For Flynn and Albie O, offer gentle, supported entries.
*   **"What's the time Mr Shark?"** (a common game, `SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, Stanley 1 Lesson Plan 3, Warm Up 3) - great for interaction and getting everyone moving.

Warm-up (6 mins):
*   **Bubbles & Submerging:** Hold onto wall, blow rhythmic bubbles. Progress to "Underwater Progression" chin-lips-nose-eyes (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 4, 88). This is critical for Albie O, Harrison, Kieran, Flynn, Arlo F-B. Offer choices for submerging (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 86).
*   **Floating Shapes (Stage 4, Skill 1):** Practice "Breakfast" game - making different shapes while floating on front and back (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, page 43). "Fried Eggs" (spread out wide float), "Baked Beans" (curled up tuck float). This targets Arlo F-B, Ezra, Harrison, Kieran, Olivia G.
*   **"Motorbike Woggle" Kick (Front Crawl):** Using the "Motorbike/Pretzel Woggle" technique, kick 5m Front Crawl. This provides stability for new kickers.

Main Activity (12 mins):
*   **Kicking Progression (Front Crawl, Backstroke, Breaststroke) - (Stage 4, Skills 3, 4, 6):**
    *   **Segment 1 (Front Crawl Kick):** Use kickboards/woggles. Focus on "floppy ankles" and continuous kicking (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 18). Albie O, Harrison, Kieran, Arlo F-B receive direct support and demonstration.
    *   **Segment 2 (Backstroke Kick):** Use kickboards/woggles. Practice "Backstroke Legs" - small, quick kicks from the hip, keeping the body flat and chin slightly tucked (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 35). This avoids "vampire neck". Targeted for Albie O, Harrison, Kieran.
    *   **Segment 3 (Breaststroke Kick):** Focus on "Lift, Flex, Circle, Push and Squeeze" (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 36). Practice sitting on the wall first, then with woggles. Targeted for Albie O, Harrison, Kieran, Olivia G.
    *   **Top-and-Tailing:** Swimmers rotate through these kick stations, ensuring maximum activity and individual feedback. Use command language: "Albie, kick 5m Front Crawl with the kickboard, aiming for constant splashes. Ready? Go!" (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 54).
*   **Push and Glide (Stage 4, Skills 2, 10):**
    *   **Drill:** Push and glide from the wall (front and back) in streamline position (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 20). Focus on "Lock your thumb, Squeeze your ears, Look down" for streamline.
    *   **Challenge:** Push and glide then swim 10m (choice of stroke). Jacob and Maisie can focus on maintaining streamline into a strong stroke.

Contrast Activity (5 mins):
*   **Sculling Introduction (Stage 4, Skill 7):**
    *   **Introduction:** Briefly introduce head-first sculling on the back. Mayra (Needs Practice) gets focused attention. For Harrison, Kieran, Olivia G (Not assessed), this is a gentle introduction.
    *   **Assisted Practice:** Use woggles for support under the hips. Guide hand movements for a gentle sculling action.
*   **"Stanley's Toy Box" Game (Top-and-Tailing):** Throw floating toys across the lane. Swimmers push and glide to collect one toy and bring it back, focusing on either their best kick or sculling (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, page 41). This provides an engaging, active way to practice skills without explicitly 'drilling'.

Cooldown & Fun (3 mins):
*   **"Woggle Waterfall":** Swimmers line up, teacher creates a "waterfall" with a woggle/watering can (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, Stanley 1 Lesson Plan 4, Main Theme 1) or by gently splashing over their heads. This reinforces water confidence in a fun way.
*   **Praise & Review:** Praise all swimmers for their effort and hard work, especially the lower ability ones. Give specific, positive feedback. "Maisie, thank you for being a great helper today. Jacob, excellent streamline!"

--- [Processing: 17:30 Stage 2] ---
My Analysis:
Note: Ella E and Emma E (twins) need to be separated to prevent "havoc" (`SEQL1ASSISTANT.pdf`, page 6, *'separating two disruptive participants'*). Marley is trying hard but "uneasy"; she needs continued positive reinforcement (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 64-65). Olivia T "consistently climbs out, doesn't listen and rarely even talks to me"; she needs rapport building and choices to earn trust (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 58, 86). Alfie is low progress (37%) with "Needs Practice" in jumping, bubbles, log rolls, and various leg actions. Many students need practice with "Tuck to rotate from front to back" (Skill 9) and "Travel using recognised leg action on front" (Skill 8). Log rolls (Skill 12) are also a common "Needs Practice"/"Fair".
Planning Method: Top-and-Tailing

Class: 17:30 Stage 2 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing tuck to rotate skills, strengthening front crawl leg kick, and reinforcing log rolls, with careful behavior management and trust-building for individual swimmers.
Swimmers: 9
Equipment: 9 Woggles, 5 kickboards, sinking rings, small floating toys, 2 hoops

Introduction & Safety (4 mins):
*   **Welcome & Rapport:** Greet swimmers. Engage Olivia T with a gentle, non-threatening question (e.g., "What's your favorite animal today?"). Use non-verbal cues like a smile and thumbs up (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 65).
*   **Separation of Twins:** Place Ella E at one end of the lane and Emma E at the other, or ensure they are separated by other swimmers in the line to prevent disruption.
*   **Rules & Entries:** Review safe entry (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, Stanley 2 Lesson Plan 1, Warm Up 2). For Alfie, focus on a safe step-in entry with encouragement ("Great job stepping in safely, Alfie!").
*   **"Simon Says"** (game for engagement, `SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, Stanley 2 Lesson Plan 3, Warm Up 5).

Warm-up (6 mins):
*   **Bubbles & Water Confidence:** Practice blowing rhythmic bubbles (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, Stanley 2, Skill 3). For Alfie and Arlo W-H (Fair), encourage more consistent submerging.
*   **Floating & Regaining Feet:** Practice moving from flat floating on front to standing (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, Stanley 2, Skill 4).
*   **"Motorbike/Pretzel Woggle" Kick (Front):** Use "Motorbike/Pretzel Woggle" technique (woggle under arms/chest). Kick 5m Front Crawl style, focusing on continuous leg action (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 18). This helps with "Travel using recognised leg action... on the front" (Skill 8) for Arlo W-H, Olivia T, Alfie, Emma MA, Lottie.

Main Activity (12 mins):
*   **Tuck to Rotate from Front to Back (Stage 2, Skill 9):**
    *   **Demonstration & Core Practice:** Demonstrate tucking from a front float, rotating to a back float, then standing. Emphasize "tuck your knees to your chest, lift your bottom to the sky" (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 46 - Chin tuck, lift butt for flip turns is a similar tuck action).
    *   **Progression 1 (Assisted):** Swimmers perform a front float (woggle optional), then tuck and rotate with hands-on assistance from the teacher. Ella E, Elodie, Emma E, Olivia T receive focused support.
    *   **Progression 2 (Independent):** Reduce support. Use a floating hoop as a target to rotate *over* for visual cue. Encourage maintaining a tuck before extending to the back float.
    *   **"Unconventional Drills" (Floating Islands):** Use floating mats or kickboards as "islands." Swimmers front float to an island, perform a tuck to rotate next to it, then back float to another island. This makes skill practice a game.
*   **Travel using Leg Action on Front (Stage 2, Skill 8):**
    *   **Drill:** Push from wall and glide on front, then kick 5m using Front Crawl leg action. Emphasize consistent, propulsive kicks. Arlo W-H and Olivia T (Needs Practice) get targeted coaching. Alfie, Emma MA, Lottie (Not assessed) focus on building confidence with any front kick.
    *   **"Woggle Race" (Top-and-Tailing):** Two students hold one woggle and kick across 5m (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, page 43). This encourages strong, sustained kicking.

Contrast Activity (5 mins):
*   **Log Roll Practice (Stage 2, Skill 12):**
    *   **Drill:** From a front float, log roll onto the back. Focus on smooth, continuous rotation. Targeted for Alfie, Elodie (Needs Practice), Ella E, Emma E, Emma MA, Lottie (Fair).
    *   **Progression:** From a back float, log roll onto the front.
*   **"Motorbike/Pretzel Woggle" for Back Kicking:** Swimmers sit on woggles (like a pretzel) and kick backwards for 5m, focusing on "Backstroke Legs" (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 35) (Stage 2, Skill 7 for Ella E and Alfie).
*   **Olivia T Engagement:** Offer Olivia a choice of activity from this section, e.g., "Olivia, would you like to try log rolls, or help me put out the floating hoops for the islands game?" Giving her a sense of agency and importance (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 93 - Respect choices).

Cooldown & Fun (3 mins):
*   **"Seahorse Races":** Swimmers sit on woggles and paddle with arms and legs across the lane (`SEQRESOURCE.pdf`, Stanley 2 Lesson Plan 3, Contrasting Activity 1).
*   **Review & Praise:** Gather at the wall. Praise specific efforts and achievements. "Marley, your kicking has been super strong today, well done!" "Ella and Emma, fantastic tuck turns, even when you were apart!" Provide gentle encouragement for Olivia's participation, even small attempts (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, page 69). Recap what was learned.
