--- [Processing: 16:00 Stage 4] ---
My Analysis
*   **Ad-Hoc Notes:** Felix Greenoff-Cairns had a meltdown last week and refused to swim. This indicates a significant water confidence issue. Planning must prioritize providing choices, reassurance, and never forcing participation, especially with submersion. (`SWIMTEACHV3.pdf`, p. 90-93 "Addressing Fear", p. 58-59 "Earning Trust"). Activities for Felix will be adapted to focus on comfort and choice, aiming for partial engagement without pressure.
*   **Long-Term Analysis:** The class has a recurring theme of "Good" or "Fair" in kicking drills (Backstroke and Butterfly) and "Fair" in sculling. Albie Edgington-Turner, Elijah Hall, Felix Greenoff-Cairns, Ihechidere Mejeha, and Leo Thornton are all "Good" in Butterfly Kick, while Ihechidere and Leo are "Fair" in sculling. Esmae Bateman, Felix Greenoff-Cairns, and Ihechidere Mejeha are "Good" in Push and glide to floor. Arthur Williams and Thea Abraham are at 100% progress.
*   **Current Report Analysis:** Primary skill gaps are "Fair" in head-first sculling for Ihechidere Mejeha and Leo Thornton. Several students (Albie, Elijah, Felix, Ihechidere, Leo) are "Good" in Butterfly kick, indicating it's an area for refinement. Push and glide from the wall towards the pool floor is "Good" for Esmae, Felix, and Ihechidere, which can be further developed.
*   **Planning Method:** Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing).

---
Class: 16:00 Stage 4 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing head-first sculling, refining butterfly kick, and practicing push and glide to the pool floor, with sensitive adaptation for Felix's water confidence.
Swimmers: 8
Equipment: Woggles (8), Kickboards (8), Sinking Rings (6)

**Introduction & Safety (4 mins):**
*   Welcome and quick safety reminder: "Show me your listening ears and looking eyes!" (Referencing `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p. 10 Stanley 4: Learning Outcome 1: "Answer 2 questions on poolside safety").
*   **For Felix:** Acknowledge his presence warmly, offer a choice to sit on the side or slowly enter the water with assistance, no pressure. "Felix, it's good to see you. You can choose to start on the side today, or walk into the shallow end with me. We'll find something you feel happy doing." (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 92 "Reassurance", "Adaptation").
*   Enter water safely, demonstrate the correct method (e.g., swivel entry or stepping in).
*   Ask swimmers to demonstrate 2 poolside safety rules, e.g., walking, sitting.

**Warm-up (6 mins):**
*   **Unconventional Drill: "Wobbly Jellyfish Walk"**: Swimmers walk across the width of the lane in different directions (forwards, backwards, sideways) pretending their legs are wobbly jellyfish, focusing on balance. (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 60 "Using Images" for creative language, `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p. 11 Stanley 4: Teaching Objective "Body control").
*   **"Motorbike Woggle Journey" (Stage 1/2 Technique, adapted for Stage 4):** Swimmers sit on woggles like motorbikes, kicking gently across the lane. Encourage a relaxed, "floppy" kick. This is a low-pressure activity good for overall leg engagement. (Ref: `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p. 4 "Woggles", `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 18 "Floppy ankles").
*   **For Felix:** Offer him a woggle to hold onto while gently kicking or simply walking in the water, ensuring he stays within his comfort zone. "Felix, do you want to be a motorbike today, or would you prefer to walk like a penguin?" (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 86 "Give a choice, even if limited").
*   Light stretching: "Reach for the sky" and "Touch your toes" in the water.

**Main Activity (10 mins):**
*   **Top-and-Tailing "Sculling Scoops & Butterfly Kicks"**:
    *   **Group A (Ihechidere, Leo, Developing):** Focus on Stage 4 Skill 7: "Perform a head first sculling action for 5 metres in a flat position on the back." Swimmers push off from one end on their back, using head-first sculling with a woggle if needed (under arms/hips) for support. Emphasize a flat body position and sculling action from the hands, looking for gentle water movement. (Ref: `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p. 11 Stanley 4: Learning Outcome 7).
    *   **Group B (Albie, Elijah, Esmae, Felix, Advanced):** Focus on refining Stage 4 Skill 5: "Kick 10 metres Butterfly on the front or on the back." Using kickboards, swimmers practice butterfly kick for 10m. Emphasize the "Dolphin strong" kick originating from the chest, flowing through hips and toes. "Think of your body as a flowing wave." (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 42 "Butterfly Kick - Undulation", p. 60 "Using Images").
    *   **Rotation:** Groups will go down the lane, then walk back along the side to allow the next pair to go. Top-and-Tailing ensures continuous movement.
*   **For Felix:** During Butterfly kick, offer a kickboard or woggle and focus purely on gentle leg movement, making no demands about head position or submersion. If he refuses, encourage him to observe or play with a floating toy nearby. "Felix, would you like to make big splashes with your feet like a dolphin, or maybe you'd like to help me collect the red rings?" (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 58 "Give swimmers an option to participate").
*   **Advanced Challenge (Arthur, Thea):** Integrate sculling on back into butterfly kick sets, e.g., "5m scull, then 5m butterfly kick."

**Contrast Activity (5 mins):**
*   **"Deep Sea Diver" (Push and Glide to Floor, Stage 4 Skill 2):** Swimmers push and glide from the wall towards the pool floor, aiming to touch the bottom gently before returning to the surface. Focus on a streamlined entry. "Be like a torpedo shooting to the treasure!" (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 20 "Streamline").
*   **Adaptation for Esmae, Felix, Ihechidere (Good in this skill):** Encourage them to push off and glide further or retrieve a sinking ring from the bottom after the glide.
*   **For Felix:** This activity involves submersion. Offer a modified version where he pushes and glides with his face in the water, but does not have to go deep or touch the bottom. Emphasize it's *his* choice to go under. If he declines, have him watch others or do a "blowing bubbles race" across the surface with small toys.

**Cooldown & Fun (5 mins):**
*   **"Sinking Treasure Hunt"**: Drop sinking rings in the shallow end. Swimmers retrieve them, encouraging gentle submersion and blowing bubbles. (Ref: `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p. 3 "Sinking rings and animal shapes are used to encourage underwater retrieving").
*   **For Felix:** Again, offer him the choice to retrieve, or to simply watch and splash. No pressure. Focus on positive reinforcement for any engagement. "Great job trying, Felix! You're so good at splashing like a waterfall!" (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 64 "Praise the Effort").
*   Review lesson highlights, praise effort, and encourage positive thoughts about swimming.
*   Safe exit from the water.

My Analysis
*   **Ad-Hoc Notes/Weekly Notes:** None.
*   **Long-Term Analysis:** Jonathan Baggs and Teo Bakrali consistently show "Needs Practice" in "Perform a movement sequence (linking skills with strokes & sculls)". Dastan Miles consistently struggles with the "Push and glide and swim 100 meters, using a minimum of three different strokes" ("Needs Practice"). Dusty Houghton has very low overall progress (55%) with "Needs Practice" in Front Crawl and Breaststroke, "Fair" in Butterfly, 100m swim, and obstacle course. Jessica Barrett and Teddy Stenson also have "Fair" in obstacle course. Arash Javadi, Moustafa Mohammed, and Samuel Hadland are nearing or at 100% progress.
*   **Current Report Analysis:** The most critical gaps are the "Movement sequence" for Jonathan and Teo, and the "100m multi-stroke swim" for Dastan and Dusty. Dusty Houghton's overall low progress requires broad stroke development, especially in Front Crawl and Breaststroke. Obstacle course completion is "Fair" for Dusty, Jessica, Teddy, and Teo, which can be integrated into skill sequencing.
*   **Planning Method:** Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing). Surface Dive Progression is relevant for Stage 6+.

---
Class: 16:30 Stage 7 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing complex movement sequences, building 100m multi-stroke endurance, and targeting stroke refinement for Front Crawl and Breaststroke, incorporating surface dive progression for suitable swimmers.
Swimmers: 9
Equipment: Pull buoys (9), Kickboards (9), Floating Hoops (3), Sinking Rings (6), Noodles (3)

**Introduction & Safety (4 mins):**
*   Welcome and safety briefing, including lane etiquette for top-and-tailing. "Remember to keep an eye on your lane partners and maintain safe distances."
*   Brief overview of today's focus on linking skills and endurance.
*   Dynamic warm-up on poolside: arm circles, leg swings, gentle stretches.

**Warm-up (6 mins):**
*   **Top-and-Tailing "Mixed Stroke Kicking Chain"**: Swimmers kick 25m down the lane with kickboards, using a different stroke's leg action each time (e.g., Front Crawl kick, then Backstroke kick, then Breaststroke kick, then Butterfly kick). Focus on consistent propulsion and body position.
    *   **Differentiation:**
        *   **Dusty, Dastan:** Focus on consistent, strong kicks for Front Crawl and Breaststroke, using the kickboard for stability.
        *   **Jonathan, Teo:** Encourage good body position during kicks as a foundation for movement sequences.
        *   **Arash, Moustafa, Samuel (Advanced):** Maintain a strong pace and perfectly aligned body position.
*   **"Underwater Tunnel Glides"**: Push and glide through 2-3 floating hoops held just below the surface, encouraging streamlining and breath control.

**Main Activity (12 mins):**
*   **Top-and-Tailing "Skill Sequence Challenge"**: Swimmers perform a sequence of linked skills for 25m:
    *   Push and glide in streamline.
    *   5m Front Crawl (focus on breathing to the side, for Dusty specifically).
    *   Log roll onto back.
    *   5m Backstroke (focus on "Backstroke Legs" technique - strong, narrow kicks, slight chin tuck, "Thumb, Hi, Pinky, Push" arm recovery).
    *   Perform a tuck float, then return to standing.
    *   **Differentiation:**
        *   **Jonathan, Teo (Needs Practice in Movement Sequence):** Focus on smooth transitions between skills. Break down the sequence: practice the first two elements, then add the next, providing clear cues. "Let's link those movements like beads on a string!" (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 41 "Discussion Topic #2: Dancing?" on choreography, `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p. 12 Stanley 7 Skill 5 "Perform a movement sequence").
        *   **Dusty, Dastan (Needs Practice in 100m Swim & Strokes):** Emphasize consistent stroke technique during the Front Crawl and Backstroke sections. Ensure good breathing for Front Crawl and body position for Backstroke.
        *   **Arash, Moustafa, Samuel (Advanced):** Add a longer distance (e.g., 50m) or perform the sequence with fewer breaths/faster transitions. Incorporate "Unconventional Drills" like imagining pushing water away with "sticky hands" for more power.
*   **Surface Dive Progression (Stage 6+ Technique):** For swimmers who have passed dive criteria (most should at Stage 7, like Arash, Dastan, Dusty, Jessica, Moustafa, Samuel, Teddy, Teo), introduce a basic surface dive progression.
    *   From a compact floating position, tuck the head and push hands down to drive the body underwater.
    *   Retrieve a sinking ring from the bottom.
    *   Progress to a shallow, controlled dive into the water, tucking immediately for a deeper trajectory. (Ref: User Methodology "Surface Dive Progression").

**Contrast Activity (5 mins):**
*   **Top-and-Tailing "Breaststroke Kick & Glide Race"**:
    *   Using pull buoys (to isolate legs), swimmers perform 25m Breaststroke kick. Focus on the "Lift, Flex, Circle, Push and Squeeze" technique. "Imagine 'scooping the ice cream' with the soles of your feet." (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 36-37 "Breaststroke Kick", p. 60 "Using Images").
    *   **Differentiation:**
        *   **Dusty, Teddy (Needs Practice/Fair Breaststroke):** Emphasize a strong, controlled "flex" and "squeeze" phase. Use a noodle for extra buoyancy if needed to focus solely on leg action.
        *   **Others:** Focus on maintaining a tight streamline during the glide phase after the kick.
*   Brief discussion on stroke efficiency and how the kick propels the body forward.

**Cooldown & Fun (3 mins):**
*   **"Eggbeater Buoyancy Challenge"**: Tread water using eggbeater kick for 30 seconds (Stage 7 Skill 9). Challenge swimmers to lift one arm, then both arms, out of the water.
*   Review the lesson, focusing on linking skills and individual achievements.
*   Safe exit, congratulating swimmers on their hard work.

--- [Processing: 17:00 Stage 4] ---
My Analysis
*   **Ad-Hoc Notes/Weekly Notes:** None specific to this class.
*   **Long-Term Analysis:** This class also exhibits a strong trend of struggling with various kicking drills, particularly Backstroke and Butterfly. Albie Oldham consistently shows "Needs Practice" in Backstroke and Butterfly kicking, and Breaststroke kick, plus "Needs Practice" in floating. Flynn Mcmanus is significantly behind (23%) with "Needs Practice" in Breaststroke kick and many "Not assessed" skills. Harrison and Kieran Waldron consistently struggle with Backstroke and Butterfly kicking ("Needs Practice"). Olivia Gwin has "Needs Practice" in floating and Breaststroke kick. Oakley Richardson is at 0% with all skills "Not assessed," requiring foundational work. Mayra Ceita has "Needs Practice" in sculling.
*   **Current Report Analysis:** Major group-wide "Needs Practice" in Backstroke Kick (Albie, Harrison, Kieran), Butterfly Kick (Albie, Harrison, Kieran), and Breaststroke Kick (Albie, Flynn, Harrison, Olivia). Floating is also "Needs Practice" for Olivia and "Good" for Albie/Flynn/Harrison/Kieran. Sculling is "Needs Practice" for Mayra and "Not assessed" for several others (Albie, Arlo, Ezra, Flynn, Harrison, Kieran, Olivia, Oakley). Oakley and Flynn are significantly behind and need intensive foundational focus.
*   **Planning Method:** Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing).

---
Class: 17:00 Stage 4 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing and refining kicking technique for Backstroke, Butterfly, and Breaststroke, reinforcing foundational skills like floating and gliding, and introducing head-first sculling for all.
Swimmers: 9
Equipment: Kickboards (9), Woggles (9), Floating Discs (optional, for buoyancy for weaker swimmers), Sinking Rings (6)

**Introduction & Safety (4 mins):**
*   Welcome and safety rules, "Eyes up, ears listening!" (Ref: `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p. 11 Stanley 4: Learning Outcome 1 "Answer 2 questions on poolside safety").
*   Special welcome to Oakley and Flynn, ensuring they feel comfortable. Offer them a choice for initial entry.
*   Quick check on water comfort and readiness.

**Warm-up (6 mins):**
*   **"Starfish Floats and Rolls" (for Floating, Stage 4 Skill 1):** Swimmers enter the water, perform a supported star float on their back, then log roll onto their front (Stage 4 Skills 8 & 9). Focus on relaxation and controlled rotation.
    *   **Differentiation:**
        *   **Olivia, Albie, Flynn, Oakley (Needs Practice/Good Floating):** Provide direct support for floating, emphasizing long, relaxed bodies. For Oakley/Flynn, focus on getting comfortable moving on front/back with support.
        *   **Others:** Focus on smooth, continuous log rolls.
*   **"Motorboat Kicks" (Warm-up for all kicks):** Using woggles under their arms, swimmers kick across the lane focusing on strong, continuous leg action from the hips. "Let's make our legs churn like a motorboat!" (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 18 "Flutter Kick - begins at the hip").

**Main Activity (10 mins):**
*   **Top-and-Tailing "Triple Threat Kicking Drills"**: Swimmers will rotate through three kicking stations, each 25m down the lane, focusing on different strokes.
    *   **Station 1 (Backstroke Kick, Stage 4 Skill 3):** Using kickboards on their stomachs (held in hands) or woggles under arms, kick 25m on back. Emphasize "Backstroke Legs" - narrow, continuous kicks, slightly tucked chin to prevent "vampire neck". (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 34-35 "Back Crawl Arms" & "Common Mistake: Poor Kick/Vampire Neck").
        *   **Targeted for:** Albie, Arlo, Harrison, Kieran.
    *   **Station 2 (Butterfly Kick, Stage 4 Skill 5):** Using kickboards held out front, kick 25m on front. Focus on the "undulation" from the chest and hips. "Be a dolphin, creating a wave with your whole body!" (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 42-43 "Butterfly Kick - Undulation").
        *   **Targeted for:** Albie, Harrison, Kieran.
    *   **Station 3 (Breaststroke Kick, Stage 4 Skill 6):** Using kickboards, kick 25m Breaststroke on front. Emphasize "Lift, Flex, Circle, Push and Squeeze" action. (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 36-37 "Breaststroke Kick").
        *   **Targeted for:** Albie, Flynn, Harrison, Olivia.
*   **Rotation:** Swimmers complete one kick, walk back to the side, and move to the next station.
*   **For Oakley & Flynn:** During kick drills, offer maximum support (e.g., woggle under arms, floating disc, or even direct hand support). Focus on any leg movement, praising effort. If overwhelmed, allow them to sit and observe or participate in a simpler floating activity near the side. "Oakley, let's just make small splashes with our feet today, like raindrops!" (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 58 "Earning Trust", p. 64 "Praise the Effort").

**Contrast Activity (7 mins):**
*   **"Sculling Superheroes" (Head-first Sculling, Stage 4 Skill 7):**
    *   Swimmers push off from the wall onto their backs in a flat position. Practice head-first sculling for 5m. Emphasize gentle, continuous hand movements near the hips to maintain a flat body.
    *   **Targeted for:** Mayra (Needs Practice), Albie, Arlo, Ezra, Flynn, Harrison, Kieran, Olivia, Oakley (Not Assessed).
    *   **Unconventional Drill:** "Imagine you're painting the water with your hands, making gentle waves to glide forward." (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 60 "Using Images").
*   **Differentiation:**
    *   For those finding it difficult, allow a woggle under the hips to help maintain body position, focusing just on arm movements.
    *   For Ezra (progressing well), challenge him to scull with minimal or no leg movement.

**Cooldown & Fun (3 mins):**
*   **"Sinking Treasure Dive"**: Drop several sinking rings in the shallow end. Encourage swimmers to push and glide to retrieve them, practicing gentle submersion and blowing bubbles.
*   Review progress, focusing on effort and individual improvements. Positive feedback is key.
*   Safe exit from the water.

---
--- [Processing: 17:30 Stage 2] ---
My Analysis
*   **Ad-Hoc Notes/Weekly Notes:** None.
*   **Long-Term Analysis:** Consistent issues with rotational skills (tuck to rotate, log rolls) and specific travel leg actions. Alfie Smith has "Needs Practice" in "Jump in from poolside safely" and "Fair" in travel/rotational skills. Emma Mariel Albert and Lottie Hinton have multiple "Not assessed" skills in key areas. Arlo Waldron-Harvey, Ella Ebony, Elodie Blackshaw, Emma Ebony, and Olivia Trussler all have "Needs Practice" or "Fair" in tuck to rotate.
*   **Current Report Analysis:** There is a significant group-wide "Needs Practice" in "Perform a tuck to rotate from a flat floating position on the front, to a back floating position, then return to standing" (Ella, Elodie, Emma E., Olivia). "Travel using a recognised leg action" (back for Ella, front for Alfie, Olivia, Emma MA) also shows "Needs Practice" or "Fair". Alfie, Emma Mariel, and Lottie require reinforcement of foundational skills like safe entry/exit and basic travel. Marley Hampson Jones is progressing well.
*   **Planning Method:** Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing). "Motorbike/Pretzel Woggle" is a core technique for Stage 1/2.

---
Class: 17:30 Stage 2 | Method: Single-Lane (Top-and-Tailing)
Focus: Developing tuck to rotate skills (front to back and back to front), refining recognised leg actions for front and back travel, and reinforcing water safety elements using fun and engaging methods.
Swimmers: 9
Equipment: Woggles (9), Floating Hoops (3), Small Floating Toys (5-6)

**Introduction & Safety (4 mins):**
*   Welcome and clear safety rules, especially for safe entry and poolside behaviour. "Let's be 'listening robots' today!" (Ref: `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 54 "Using Command Language", `SEQRESOURCE.pdf` p. 10 Stanley 2: Learning Outcome 1 & 2).
*   **For Alfie, Emma Mariel, Lottie:** Ensure safe water entry. Provide extra support if they seem hesitant, offering choice and reassurance. "You can jump in with two hands on the side, or step in carefully like a cat."
*   Brief on today's focus on turning in the water and strong kicks.

**Warm-up (6 mins):**
*   **"Motorbike/Pretzel Woggle Ride"**: Swimmers sit on a woggle ("motorbike"), kicking across the width of the lane, focusing on a continuous leg action (Stage 2 Skill 7/8 focus).
    *   **Unconventional Drill:** "Imagine your woggle is a fast motorbike, and your legs are the powerful engine!" (Ref: User Methodology "Motorbike/Pretzel Woggle", `SWIMTEACHV3.pdf` p. 60 "Using Images").
*   **Differentiation:**
    *   **Alfie, Ella, Emma Mariel, Lottie, Olivia:** Focus on keeping legs straight and toes pointed, making big splashes for backstroke kick, or continuous, small splashes for front paddle. Provide gentle physical guidance for leg action if needed.
    *   **Marley:** Challenge with kicking faster or demonstrating the technique.
*   **"Bubble Monster Contest"**: Swimmers hold the wall, submerge nose and mouth, and blow bubbles (Stage 2 Skill 2). Encourage rhythmic blowing.

**Main Activity (10 mins):**
*   **Top-and-Tailing "Tuck & Roll Transformations"**: Focus on Stage 2 Skill 9 (front to back) and Skill 10 (back to front) rotational skills.
    *   **Progression 1: Front to Back Tuck & Roll**: Swimmers push off from the wall on their front, hold a tuck position briefly, then rotate to their back and return to standing. "Become a little ball, then 'pop' onto your back like popcorn!"
        *   **Differentiation (Ella, Elodie, Emma E., Olivia - Needs Practice):** Break it down: first, just practice tucking their knees to their chest, then adding a gentle push to initiate the roll. Use a woggle under the arms for buoyancy during the roll.
        *   **Alfie, Emma Mariel, Lottie (Not assessed):** Provide maximum support (instructor hands on back/hips) throughout the tuck and roll, focusing on the feeling of rotation. Keep it gentle and fun.
        *   **Marley:** Challenge to perform the roll without a tuck, or with a controlled somersault-like motion.
    *   **Progression 2: Back to Front Tuck & Roll**: Swimmers push off from the wall on their back, tuck into a ball, then rotate to their front and return to standing. "Like a submarine turning around!"
        *   Apply similar differentiation strategies.
*   **"Backstroke Legs" practice (Stage 2 Skill 7, adapted):** For swimmers specifically needing backstroke leg action (Ella, Alfie, Lottie), incorporate a segment focusing on "Backstroke Legs" - gentle, continuous kicks from the hips, minimal knee bend. "Make tiny ripples on the water with your toes!" (Ref: User Methodology "Backstroke Legs").

**Contrast Activity (7 mins):**
*   **"Floating Hoop Challenge" (Travel using Leg Action):** Swimmers travel 5m using recognised leg action on their front (Stage 2 Skill 8) or back (Stage 2 Skill 7) through floating hoops. "Swim through the magic tunnels!"
    *   **Differentiation:**
        *   **Alfie, Ella, Emma Mariel, Lottie, Olivia (Needs Practice/Fair in Travel Leg Action):** Use woggles under arms or kickboards to focus solely on leg propulsion. Provide clear cues for straight legs and continuous kick.
        *   **Marley:** Challenge to travel further or faster through the hoops.
*   **"Safe Jump and Exit"**: Practice jumping safely into the pool (Stage 2 Skill 1, for Alfie primarily) and exiting without support (Stage 2 Skill 13, for Emma Mariel, Lottie). Emphasize looking before jumping and climbing out efficiently.

**Cooldown & Fun (3 mins):**
*   **"Toy Island Rescue"**: Scatter small floating toys in the shallow end. Swimmers "rescue" them, gently moving on their front or back.
*   Positive praise for effort, especially for trying new skills and rotational movements.
*   Safe exit from the water.
